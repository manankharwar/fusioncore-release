# Known Limitations

These are limitations of the current implementation, not bugs. Each entry includes why it exists and what the workaround or planned fix is.

## GPS blackouts longer than 5-7 minutes cause heading drift

During GPS blackouts, FusionCore dead-reckons on IMU and wheel encoders. The encoder WZ bias (`B_EWZ`) is calibrated from GPS heading cross-covariance before the blackout and subtracted during it. For blackouts up to a few minutes, this works well. Beyond 5-7 minutes, the residual uncorrected heading rate error (thermal drift in `B_EWZ`, temperature-dependent gyro drift) accumulates into position error quadratically.

On the NCLT 2012-06-15 sequence (461-second blackout), FC accumulated significant heading error. See [issue #63](https://github.com/manankharwar/fusioncore/issues/63).

**Workaround:** If your platform has a magnetometer and your operating environment has low magnetic interference, fusing magnetometer heading during blackouts closes this observability gap. Magnetometer support is on the roadmap.

## Adversarial GPS outlier clusters at blackout boundaries can corrupt the estimate

FusionCore's chi2 gate relaxes during GPS blackout recovery (`coast_q_factor`) to accept valid returning fixes after the predicted covariance inflates. If a cluster of corrupt GPS fixes arrives at exactly the re-acquisition moment, the relaxed gate may accept them before the filter's state recovers.

This pattern appears in NCLT 2012-08-20: 105 mode-3 GPS fixes 720-840 m off RTK arrive in a 24-second window at the end of a 211-second blackout. The filter accepts them, spikes to ~788 m error, and recovers within 2 minutes. See [issue #64](https://github.com/manankharwar/fusioncore/issues/64).

**Workaround:** Lower `gnss.coast_q_factor` to tighten the gate during recovery. This reduces the spike magnitude at the cost of slower re-acquisition after legitimate long blackouts. There is no single value that handles both cases optimally.

**Not yet implemented: velocity sanity check.** A GPS fix 720 m from the dead-reckoned position after a 211-second blackout implies ~3400 m/s of motion. A hard `max_implied_speed` check (e.g., 20 m/s) operating before the chi2 gate rejects this pattern trivially and has zero effect on normal operation. This check is tracked but not yet in the filter.

**Not yet implemented: cluster consistency gate.** A single outlier at 720 m is handled by chi2. Five consecutive fixes all landing 720-840 m from the predicted position with tight geometric consistency is a distinguishable pattern from noise. A secondary check on cluster coherence across multiple consecutive fixes would catch this without affecting single-fix rejection behavior. This is the planned architectural fix.

## IMU + encoder alone cannot separate gyro bias from encoder bias without GPS

When GPS is unavailable and both sensors are active, the system has three unknowns (WZ, B_GZ, B_EWZ) observable from two measurement equations. The system is rank-deficient.

FusionCore resolves this by treating `B_EWZ` as known from the GPS calibration phase (tight prior on `P(B_EWZ, B_EWZ)`). This works correctly during GPS blackouts when `B_EWZ` was calibrated before the blackout. It does not work if GPS was never available: `B_EWZ` remains unobservable, and the filter cannot separate the two biases.

**Workaround:** Ensure the robot operates with GPS for at least the first minute of each run to calibrate `B_EWZ`. The `init.stationary_window` setting helps calibrate `B_GZ` before motion begins.

## Non-holonomic constraint assumes flat ground

The NHC (non-holonomic constraint) zeros the lateral and vertical body-frame velocity as virtual measurements. On significant slopes or when traversing obstacles, the vertical velocity constraint briefly produces a non-zero innovation (the robot genuinely has body-frame VZ during a curb transition or a bump).

**This is handled automatically.** The VZ=0 and AZ=0 constraint noise adapts from the innovation sequence (controlled by `adaptive.ground_constraint: true`, enabled by default). When the robot hits rough terrain, large VZ or AZ innovations inflate the constraint noise within one sliding window (~1 second at encoder rate), loosening the assertion to match actual terrain behavior. When back on smooth ground, the noise relaxes back down to the configured floor values (`ground_constraint.vz_sigma` and `ground_constraint.az_sigma`). No config changes are needed when moving between terrain types.

The floor values control the minimum tightness on smooth ground:
- `ground_constraint.vz_sigma: 0.1` (default, flat floors and mild terrain)
- `ground_constraint.az_sigma: 0.5` (default, flat floors and mild terrain)

Increase these floors only if you want looser constraints even on smooth surfaces (rarely needed).

For lateral velocity: `adaptive.encoder: true` (enabled by default) adapts the VY encoder noise from innovations. For mecanum and omnidirectional robots that genuinely move laterally, set `encoder.nhc_vy_sigma: 10.0` or higher to effectively disable the lateral NHC constraint regardless of terrain.

## IMU ring buffer retrodiction assumes IMU is the highest-rate sensor

The delay compensation mechanism buffers up to 1 second of IMU measurements (at `imu.topic` rate) and replays them when a delayed GPS fix arrives. This assumes IMU arrives at the filter's nominal rate and GPS arrives late. If GPS arrives before IMU (e.g., low-frequency IMU with high-frequency GPS), the buffer does not help.

**Limitation:** The buffer covers GPS latency up to 500 ms by default (`gnss.max_delay_s`). Fixes arriving more than 500 ms late are processed at arrival time with no retrodiction.

---

## Single global config, no per-session adaptation

FusionCore's adaptive noise covariance updates within a session from the innovation sequence. It does not persist learned noise parameters across sessions or adapt its base parameters based on environment type (urban canyon, open field, indoor/outdoor).

**Workaround:** Maintain separate config files for meaningfully different operating environments and select the appropriate one at launch.

## VSLAM map frame assumed stationary

When fusing VSLAM pose (`vslam.topic`), FusionCore anchors the offset between the VSLAM map frame and the filter's odometry frame on first message. If the VSLAM system re-localizes to a different part of its map (loop closure, kidnapping recovery), the map origin shifts and the anchored offset becomes stale.

The reinitialization detector (`vslam.reinit_n`) catches large instantaneous jumps: after `vslam.reinit_n` consecutive chi2 rejections (default 10, approximately 2 seconds at 5 Hz), FusionCore re-anchors the map origin to the current filter position and resumes fusion. It does not catch slow drift due to map deformation.

**Workaround:** Trigger a filter reset (`ros2 service call /fusioncore/reset`) after VSLAM re-localization completes.
