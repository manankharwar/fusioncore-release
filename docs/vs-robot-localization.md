## Why RL-EKF fails on GPS-heavy sequences

This is the central finding from the NCLT benchmark and it affects anyone using robot_localization with GPS, not just people evaluating FusionCore.

The NCLT GPS driver reports `var_xy = 9` (3m sigma), matching the Novatel SPAN-CPT open-sky specification. Measured against RTK ground truth, actual p95 error ranges from **9.7m to 53.1m** across sequences: 2 to 18 times the stated sigma.

robot_localization calibrates its chi-squared gate to the stated covariance. When actual GPS error reaches 40-200m, those fixes land far outside the expected window and get rejected. With GPS effectively disabled, RL-EKF reverts to wheel-encoder dead-reckoning. The two worst sequences show **31.84 m/km and 50.11 m/km drift**: diagnostic of open-loop operation across full runs.

This is not a bug in robot_localization. It is what happens when you trust the covariance your GPS driver reports. Most GPS drivers report optimistic covariance. The problem compounds in any real deployment.

FusionCore maintains a 50-sample innovation window per sensor and adapts the noise model in real time:

```
R ← (1 - α)R + α·Ĉ
```

where `Ĉ` is the empirical innovation covariance and `α = 0.01`. A floor prevents collapse. The chi-squared gate stays calibrated to actual error levels regardless of what the driver reports.

RL-UKF diverged with NaN on all twelve sequences. FusionCore wins 10 of 12.

> **Note on these numbers.** This table is a snapshot pending a controlled full-suite re-run on the current `main`. The 10-of-12 result holds, but treat the individual magnitudes as directional: at least one sequence (2013-04-05) has regressed since this snapshot, so the 12.1 m figure above is stale. The regression-tracking harness and current baseline live in `tools/benchmark_regression.md` and `tools/benchmark_baseline.json`. The table will be refreshed once a verified full re-run lands.

Metric: ATE RMSE (meters), SE3-aligned to RTK ground truth using EVO. Same IMU, wheel odometry, and GPS inputs. Full methodology in the [benchmark reference](reference/benchmark.md).

## The two FusionCore losses

Both losses have identified root causes. They are documented here rather than hidden.

**2012-06-15 (FC 49.2m, RL 18.2m):** The dataset's GPS-sparsest sequence, with a 462-second blackout. During coast mode, residual wheel-encoder yaw bias (`b_ewz`) and gyro drift accumulate into quadratic position error over the multi-minute outage. RL-EKF's 2D mode has fewer divergence degrees of freedom. The lever for this is an absolute heading source during the outage: `magnetometer.enabled: true` bounds heading drift instead of letting it accumulate (demonstrated in a unit test with slipping wheel odometry). **Honesty caveat:** this cannot be validated against *this NCLT number*, the dataset publishes no usable magnetometer and its ground-truth orientation is too noisy to score a few-metre change. So the magnetometer is validated by construction and in test, and awaits real-hardware confirmation; it is not proven to close this specific loss.

**2012-08-20 (FC 98.3m, RL 10.6m):** 105 mode-3 GPS fixes located 720-840m from RTK ground truth appear in a 24-second window at a blackout boundary. Coast mode relaxes the chi-squared gate slightly to re-acquire GPS after the blackout; the adversarial cluster each individually pass the gate and collectively pull the estimate. RL-EKF incidentally rejects them through its miscalibrated gate (the same gate that causes its ten other losses). FusionCore now ships a physical-plausibility gate (`gnss.max_speed`) that rejects this cluster and cuts the peak spike. **Honesty caveat:** this does *not* fix the score. The sequence's ATE is dominated by dead-reckoning drift accumulated *during* the 211-second blackout, not by the cluster spike, so rejecting the cluster lowers the peak but not the overall number. The real lever, as with 2012-06-15, is an absolute heading source during the outage.

## RL issues FusionCore resolves

These are open robot_localization issues that describe problems FusionCore handles differently.

| robot_localization issue | What FusionCore does |

| No non-holonomic constraint ([#744](https://github.com/cra-ros-pkg/robot_localization/issues/744)) | Built-in NHC: lateral and vertical velocity zeroed as a virtual measurement |
| Delayed sensor messages cause missed updates ([#911](https://github.com/cra-ros-pkg/robot_localization/issues/911)) | IMU ring buffer with retrodiction up to 500ms |
| Non-deterministic output across bag replays ([#957](https://github.com/cra-ros-pkg/robot_localization/issues/957)) | Message timestamps drive everything under `use_sim_time: true` |
| IMU frame confusion ([#757](https://github.com/cra-ros-pkg/robot_localization/issues/757)) | TF lookup on every message, `imu.frame_id` override for broken drivers |

## See the difference in simulation

The Gazebo demo runs both filters simultaneously on the same sensor stream while the robot drives a lawnmower pattern, then injects two 60 m GPS spikes and a 25 s outage. No real hardware needed.

```bash
ros2 launch fusioncore_gazebo fusioncore_demo.launch.py
```

RViz shows green (FusionCore, which holds course through the spikes), red (robot_localization, which lurches to each spike), and yellow (raw GPS, including the spikes). See [Simulation](simulation.md#demo-fusioncore-vs-robot_localization-under-gps-spikes-and-an-outage) for details and the WSL2 transport note.
