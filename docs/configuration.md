# Configuration

FusionCore is configured with a single YAML file passed to the launch file:

```bash
ros2 launch fusioncore_ros fusioncore.launch.py \
  fusioncore_config:=/path/to/your_robot.yaml

    # The chi2 gate above cannot. It tests a fix against the FILTER, so its scale
    # is S = H P H' + R, and on a consumer receiver that is tens of square metres.
    # Measured on a u-blox at 1 Hz reporting 3.24 m sigma, by injecting a single

    # A 15 m multipath spike, ordinary beside a building or under tree cover, is
    # accepted and moves position 4.5 m. Analysis agrees with the experiment:
    # sqrt(16.27 * (5.25^2 + 3.24^2)) = 24.9 m. Fixing heading does NOT help; a
    # perfect absolute heading halved position sigma and made the gate LOOSER.
    #
    # Continuity asks a different question that never involves P: does this fix
    # agree with the fixes either side of it? With continuity at 3.0 m the same
    # spikes are rejected from 2 m upward.
    #
    # HOW TO SET IT. Measure, do not guess. tools/nis_from_bag.py reports your
    # receiver's fix-to-fix second difference. Across 2361 fixes from seven field
    # logs on one rover, a good fix had a median second difference of 0.09 to
    # 0.30 m and a p99 under 2.1 m, so 3.0 sat 10 to 30 times above normal and
    # rejected nothing that should have been kept. Dropping to 2.0 began rejecting
    # good fixes. Err generous: rejecting good data is the more expensive mistake.
    #
    # It catches JUMPS, not sustained bias. Multipath that shifts the solution and
    # holds it there breaks continuity once and then looks continuous at the new
    # offset. chi2 and coast mode still own that case, which is why this is added
    # alongside them rather than instead.
    #
    # The check is skipped unless three consecutive accepted fixes are evenly
    # spaced (within a factor of two on the interval). Across a real outage the
    # second difference is legitimately large, and rejecting the first fix after
    # one is exactly the failure gnss_coast_min_gap_s exists to prevent.

    gnss.outlier_sigma_xy: 0.0
    # Short-term consistency of the receiver in metres, used ONLY by the chi2 gate
    # above. 0.0 = gate on the same R the update uses, which is the old behaviour.
    #
    # A receiver's reported covariance describes ABSOLUTE accuracy: multipath and
    # ionospheric error that moves slowly. Consecutive fixes are far more
    # consistent than that figure implies. Measured on that same log, 3.24 m
    # declared against a 0.171 m median second difference, a factor of 55.
    #
    # The update wants the absolute figure, or the filter believes GPS to
    # centimetres it has not earned and tracks that slow bias rigidly. The gate
    # wants the short-term figure, because an outlier IS a break in short-term
    # consistency. Setting this moved the chi2 rejection threshold from 30 m to
    # 15 m with no false rejections, but it cannot go further because the filter's
    # own P remains in S. Prefer gnss.continuity_max_m for spike rejection.
    #
    # A value ABOVE the receiver's own sigma makes the gate LOOSER, not tighter:
    # 5.0 on a 3.24 m receiver moved the threshold from 26 m out to 30 m.

## Nominal IMU dt: not trusting timestamps you cannot trust

Anything downstream of an integrator amplifies timestamp error. On one recorded
run, shifting **every IMU stamp by a single microsecond** and changing nothing
else moved final yaw by **109 degrees**, and across a 120 s GNSS outage moved
final position by 50.6 m. Most of that is an unbounded quaternion covariance
rather than the stamps themselves, but the sensitivity is real.

```yaml
imu.fixed_rate_hz: 0.0    # 0 = derive dt from stamps (default). Above 0,
                          # propagate by exactly 1/rate instead.
```

Set to your IMU's real rate and the propagation step no longer depends on stamp
jitter at all. This is what Martin Pecka's team does: they never compute dt in
fusion from IMU timestamps, they assume the configured rate.

**Only set a rate you have measured.** A wrong rate is a *systematic* error, not
a noisy one: the filter integrates the wrong amount of time on every single
step, and it does not average out. A BNO085 nominally at 100 Hz has been logged
running at 103 and 109.

FusionCore watches for this. It measures the real arrival rate from the raw
stamps and sets `imu_fixed_rate_mismatch` in the status when the two differ by
more than 2%. There is a second, more visible symptom: because the filter clock
advances at the nominal rate while stamps advance at the real one, the two
separate at exactly the rate error, and once that exceeds
`max_measurement_delay` the stale-skew guard **starts rejecting your IMU**. If
you enable this and your IMU begins getting rejected, the rate is wrong.

## Stopping a parked robot chasing its GPS

When the wheels report zero velocity, FusionCore fuses a zero-velocity update
(ZUPT). That pins **velocity**, and says nothing about **position**.

The consequence is easy to miss. Position process noise keeps growing between
fixes even though the robot is not moving, so the covariance stays large, the
Kalman gain stays high, and every incoming fix drags the estimate. A receiver
that wanders while parked takes the estimate with it.

Measured on a u-blox M9N, parked for 57 seconds with wheel encoders confirming
the robot was stationary: **the receiver's reported position moved 9.76 m and
the fused position followed it for 10.16 m.** The robot did not move at all.

```yaml
zupt.velocity_threshold: 0.05      # m/s below which the robot counts as still
zupt.angular_threshold: 0.05       # rad/s, same
zupt.noise_sigma: 0.01             # m/s: how tightly to believe "not moving"
zupt.position_noise_scale: 1.0     # scale on POSITION process noise while still
zupt.accel_std_threshold: 0.5      # m/s^2: block ZUPT if the IMU disagrees
```

`zupt.accel_std_threshold` exists because wheels reporting zero is not the same
thing as a stationary robot. An encoder that dies mid-run keeps publishing zero
while the robot drives, ZUPT then pins velocity to zero and the filter spends the
rest of the run refusing to let GNSS move it. On the run that found this, the
estimate recovered about 7 m of 20 m actually driven.

The accelerometer is the one sensor that cannot be fooled by a dead encoder, so
the standard deviation of accelerometer magnitude over the last 100 samples is
checked before ZUPT is allowed to fire. Measured on this project's rover:
**1.69 to 2.25 m/s^2 while driving against 0.013 to 0.021 m/s^2 parked**, which
is two orders of magnitude of separation, so the 0.5 default sits nowhere near
either population. Set to 0 to disable the guard.

A high-vibration platform running an isolated IMU mount may need this raised;
`FusionCoreStatus::zupt_blocked_by_imu` says when the guard is the reason ZUPT
is not firing, so check that before changing it.

`zupt.position_noise_scale` is the one that fixes the drift. At 1.0 nothing
changes. Below 1.0 the position covariance stops growing while the robot is
known to be still, so it decays as fixes arrive, the gain falls, and consecutive
fixes are **averaged** rather than followed. Measured at 0.001 across 11 parked
windows from six field runs, mean excursion falls from 3.49 m to 1.64 m, loop
closure over the whole run is unchanged within noise, and no additional fixes
are rejected. The effect saturates below about 0.001, and it goes no further on
its own: see the next section for why.

It is deliberately **not** applied while GNSS coast mode is active. Coast
inflation exists so the filter can re-admit GNSS after a blackout, and silently
cancelling it here would change a behaviour this setting has nothing to do with.
The scale is handed back as soon as the encoders report motion again.

The default stays at 1.0 until this has been checked against the full NCLT
regression suite. It is measured on one robot with one receiver, which is not
enough to move a default.

### Measuring the receiver while the robot is parked

Suppressing process noise stops the covariance growing, but it does not fix the
other half of the problem. A Kalman filter assumes measurement errors are white,
so sixty parked fixes of a fixed point shrink its position uncertainty by about
sqrt(60). GNSS error is not white over a minute: multipath, ionosphere and
satellite geometry drift slowly, so consecutive fixes are largely the same error
repeated. The filter ends up far more confident than the geometry supports, each
fix keeps dragging the estimate, and it carries that over-confidence into the
next leg of the run.

Standing still is the one moment in a run where this is checkable, because every
fix is then sampling the same physical point. `zupt.gnss_noise_scale` turns that
into a correction:

```yaml
zupt.gnss_noise_scale: 1.0     # UPPER BOUND on the inflation; 1.0 disables it
zupt.gnss_min_samples: 5       # parked fixes before the measurement is trusted
```

Two things are measured from the parked fixes, per axis:

- **Magnitude.** Their spread is the receiver's real short-term sigma. Divided by
  the sigma it declares and squared, a receiver that is as good as it claims
  scores 1 and is left alone.
- **Correlation.** The lag-1 autocorrelation `r` of those fixes. The honest
  effective sample size is `N(1-r)/(1+r)`, so the measurement noise has to carry
  a factor `(1+r)/(1-r)` for the filter's own posterior to mean what it says.

The applied inflation is the product of the two, capped by
`zupt.gnss_noise_scale`. So that number bounds how far one bad parked window can
push the filter and does not decide the amount. Nothing here is tuned per
environment or per receiver.

The correlation term fires for an honest receiver too, and it should. An RTK unit
correctly reporting a 2 cm sigma still has errors correlated over minutes, so a
filter that parks for a minute and averages sixty of them is wrong about how much
it knows. That is a general defect, not a bad-receiver defect.

On the same 57-second parked window as above, with a receiver declaring 21 to 45 m
of sigma while actually spreading 0.4 to 3.3 m, the magnitude term stayed at 1.0
throughout: the receiver was not over-confident. The lag-1 autocorrelation
measured 0.63 rising to 0.985, which is an inflation of 5x rising to the 100x cap,
and it took that window's idle drift from 0.53 m to **0.10 m**. Across all 11
windows the mean falls from 1.64 m to 0.74 m, helping in 8 and hurting in none.
Whole-run loop closure was unchanged within noise.

Watch what it actually measured on `filter_health`:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /fusioncore/filter_health --field gnss_parked_correlation
```

`gnss_parked_sigma_observed` and `_declared` report the magnitude side,
`gnss_parked_correlation` the correlation side, and `gnss_parked_inflation` what
was applied after the cap. All are -1 or 1.0 until a parked window has produced
`zupt.gnss_min_samples` fixes.

**The cost, and it is real.** A robot parked for a long time cannot re-acquire if
it was genuinely lost before it stopped. For a stop of tens of seconds that does
not matter. For one parked overnight it does. The evidence is dropped the moment
the encoders report motion, so a robot that parks once does not stay
over-confident for the rest of the run.

## Secondary twist sources (`encoder2`)

`encoder2.topic` accepts a second `nav_msgs/Odometry` source and fuses it through
the same path as the wheel encoder. Typical uses are LiDAR odometry (KISS-ICP),
a tracking camera, or an optical flow sensor.

```yaml
encoder2.topic: "/odom/flow"
encoder2.vel_noise: 0.05
encoder2.yaw_noise: 0.02
encoder2.channels: ["vx", "vy"]     # default ["vx", "vy", "wz"]
```

**`encoder2.channels` matters more than it looks.** A `Twist` message always
carries all three of vx, vy and wz, so a source that measures only some of them
still publishes a number for the rest, and that number is 0.0. Once it reaches
the filter there is nothing to distinguish it from a measured zero.

The concrete case: the PMW3901 and PAA5100 optical flow drivers never assign
`angular.z` and leave `twist.covariance` at zero. Without listing channels, the
filter falls back to `encoder2.yaw_noise` and every sample arrives as a confident
"the robot is not rotating", competing with the gyro on every turn. The sensor
cannot measure yaw rate; it reported a zero because the field is a zero.

List only what the sensor genuinely measures. Anything omitted is not fused at
all, rather than fused with a large noise value.

**Optical flow specifically:** the driver converts pixels to metres using a
`z_height` parameter and the relationship is linear, so a sensor mounted at 0.25 m
while the parameter is left at its 0.025 default reports every velocity 10x too
small. Measure the real mount height.

## GNSS Doppler velocity bridge (ublox F9P / M8U)

FusionCore itself has no dependency on any specific GPS driver. It accepts velocity from any receiver via `gnss.velocity_topic`, which expects `nav_msgs/Odometry` with ENU velocity (`linear.x=east`, `linear.y=north`).

If your receiver is a u-blox module (F9P, M8U, NEO-M9N, etc.), the `fusioncore_ublox` companion package provides a ready-made bridge. It is a separate package with its own dependency on `ublox_msgs` so the FusionCore core remains clean.

```bash
# Build the companion package alongside FusionCore
colcon build --packages-select fusioncore_ros fusioncore_ublox
```

**Launch the bridge alongside FusionCore:**

```bash
# Terminal 1: FusionCore
ros2 launch fusioncore_ros fusioncore.launch.py fusioncore_config:=your_robot.yaml

# Terminal 2: ublox bridge
ros2 launch fusioncore_ublox gnss_doppler_bridge.launch.py \
  navpvt_topic:=/ublox/navpvt \
  output_topic:=/gnss/doppler_vel
```

**Matching FusionCore config:**

```yaml
gnss.velocity_topic: "/gnss/doppler_vel"
```

**What the bridge does:**

| NavPVT field | Unit | ENU output |
|---|---|---|
| `vel_e` (east) | mm/s | `twist.linear.x` (m/s) |
| `vel_n` (north) | mm/s | `twist.linear.y` (m/s) |
| `vel_d` (down) | mm/s | `twist.linear.z` = -vel_d/1000 (m/s) |
| `s_acc` | mm/s | `covariance[0,7]` = (s_acc/1000)^2 |

Fixes with `fix_type < 3` (no 3D lock) or `gnssFixOK` flag unset are silently dropped. Speeds below 0.05 m/s are also dropped to avoid heading corruption at standstill.

**Other receivers:** publish `nav_msgs/Odometry` with ENU velocity on any topic and point `gnss.velocity_topic` at it. FusionCore doesn't care which driver produced it.

## Choosing a motion model

Start with the default (`ConstantVelocityAcceleration`) unless you have a specific reason to change it. It works well for all platforms and matches what robot_localization users are used to.

Switch to `DifferentialDrive` if:
- Your robot is a differential drive, skid-steer, or tracked vehicle
- You see small lateral position drift on straight runs
- Your `VY` state doesn't stay near zero between encoder updates

Switch to `Ackermann` if:
- Your robot has front-wheel steering (car-like, forklift, outdoor field robot)
- The lateral constraint is the same as `DifferentialDrive`; `wheelbase` is stored for future minimum-turning-radius enforcement

Do not use `DifferentialDrive` or `Ackermann` for:
- Aerial vehicles (no lateral constraint applies)
- Holonomic (mecanum) platforms (those can move sideways intentionally)

---

## Wait for all sensors: replacing sleep() in launch files

A common pattern in ROS launch files is `sleep(3)` before starting the navigation stack to give sensors time to come online. This is fragile: on a slow machine the sensors might need 5 seconds, and on a fast one you waste 3 seconds on every launch.

`init.wait_for_all_sensors: true` replaces this entirely. FusionCore holds initialization until it has seen at least one message from every sensor you configured. Then it starts. No sleep needed.

```yaml
init.wait_for_all_sensors: true
init.sensor_wait_timeout: 10.0
```

The timeout is a safety net: if a sensor fails to start, the filter does not hang forever. It logs which sensors were missing and starts anyway:

```
[WARN] Sensor wait timed out after 10.0s. Missing: [GNSS]. Starting anyway.
```

This is especially useful at competition startup, on-site robot power-on, or any deployment where sensor initialization order is not guaranteed.

---

## Deterministic replay: debugging without hardware

See [How It Works: Deterministic replay](how-it-works.md#deterministic-replay-and-state-checkpoints) for the full workflow. Quick reference:

```bash
# Save filter state at any point during bag replay
ros2 service call /fusioncore/save_checkpoint std_srvs/srv/Trigger

# Restore that state instantly (no need to replay from the beginning)
ros2 service call /fusioncore/load_checkpoint std_srvs/srv/Trigger
```

The checkpoint file path is set by `replay.checkpoint_path` (default `/tmp/fusioncore_checkpoint.txt`).

---

## GPS without a fix (indoor / no GPS)

Set `reference.use_first_fix: false` and leave reference coords at 0.0. The filter starts at the origin and runs on IMU + wheel odometry alone. No GPS topics needed.

---

## Agricultural RTK (UTM output)

Some RTK receivers output easting/northing directly:

```yaml
input.gnss_crs: "EPSG:32617"        # UTM zone 17N (adjust for your zone)
output.crs: "EPSG:32617"
output.convert_to_enu_at_reference: false
reference.use_first_fix: true
```

---

## GPS receiver setup: NavSatFix vs GPSFix

FusionCore supports two GPS message types on `gnss.fix_topic` (default `/gnss/fix`). The default is `sensor_msgs/NavSatFix` because every ROS GPS driver publishes it. Set `gnss.use_gps_fix: true` to switch to `gps_msgs/GPSFix` if your driver supports it.

!!! note "`nmea_navsat_driver` does NOT publish `gps_msgs/GPSFix`"

    An earlier version of this table listed it as a `GPSFix` source. That was
    wrong, reported by a user on issue #73. Checked against the driver source:
    it publishes `sensor_msgs/NavSatFix` on `fix`, `geometry_msgs/TwistStamped`
    on `vel`, `geometry_msgs/QuaternionStamped` on `heading`, and
    `sensor_msgs/TimeReference`. If you are on `nmea_navsat_driver`, leave
    `gnss.use_gps_fix` at `false`. To get `GPSFix` from an NMEA receiver, run
    `fix_translator` from `gps_umd`, which converts `NavSatFix` to `GPSFix`.

| | `sensor_msgs/NavSatFix` | `gps_msgs/GPSFix` |
|---|---|---|
| Driver support | Universal | gpsd_client (gps_umd), septentrio_gnss_driver, swiftnav-ros2, KumarRobotics/ublox |
| RTK_FLOAT status | Not expressible | Yes (status 20) |
| Separate HDOP / VDOP | No | Yes |
| Satellites used | No | Yes |
| 95% CI error bounds | No | err_horz / err_vert |
| Covariance matrix | Yes | Yes |

### When to use NavSatFix (default)

NavSatFix works with all receivers. For most setups, leave `gnss.use_gps_fix: false`.

The only thing you cannot get via NavSatFix is RTK_FLOAT. If you are using autonomous GPS (CEP 1-3m) or RTK fixed, NavSatFix is all you need.

### When to use GPSFix

Switch to `gnss.use_gps_fix: true` when:

- Your receiver can output RTK_FLOAT and you want to fuse those fixes (better than autonomous, worse than RTK fixed). Set `gnss.min_fix_type: 3` to require it or allow it.
- Your driver publishes receiver-native HDOP/VDOP rather than a covariance matrix, and you want those values used directly in the noise model.
- Your driver sets `err_horz`/`err_vert` (95% CI bounds) and you prefer that over a synthetic covariance.

```yaml
fusioncore:
  ros__parameters:
    gnss.use_gps_fix: true
    gnss.min_fix_type: 3      # require RTK_FLOAT or better (3=FLOAT, 4=FIXED)
    gnss.base_noise_xy: 0.5   # metres: baseline at HDOP=1 for RTK_FLOAT
    gnss.base_noise_z: 1.0
```

### Covariance priority (GPSFix)

When `gnss.use_gps_fix: true`, FusionCore picks the best available covariance source in this order:

1. `position_covariance_type == 3` (full 3x3): used directly, including off-diagonal terms.
2. `position_covariance_type >= 1` (diagonal): diagonal elements used, hdop/vdop derived from them.
3. `err_horz > 0` and `err_vert > 0`: 95% CI bounds converted to 1-sigma variance (divide by 1.96), used as a diagonal covariance.
4. `hdop > 0` and `vdop > 0`: receiver-native DOP values used directly in the noise model (`sigma_xy = base_noise_xy * hdop`).
5. Defaults (`hdop=1.5, vdop=2.0`).

---

!!! warning "Upgrading from an older config"
    If your YAML has `ukf.q_orientation: 0.01`, change it to `1.0e-9` or delete the line. The old value corrupts quaternion math at typical IMU rates and causes yaw drift and Z-axis rise in simulation.
