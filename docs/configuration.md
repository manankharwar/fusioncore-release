# Configuration

FusionCore is configured with a single YAML file passed to the launch file:

```bash
ros2 launch fusioncore_ros fusioncore.launch.py \
  fusioncore_config:=/path/to/your_robot.yaml
```

    # In coast mode: (1) P is inflated by coast_q_factor each step so the filter
    # stays open to correction, (2) the next fix is tested against a gate inflated
    # by degraded_noise_multiplier, giving it a wider acceptance window.
    # This breaks the cascade rejection loop where a stationary or slowly-drifting

## Choosing a motion model

Start with the default (`ConstantVelocityAcceleration`) unless you have a specific reason to change it. It works well for all platforms and matches what robot_localization users are used to.

Switch to `DifferentialDrive` if:
- Your robot is a differential drive, skid-steer, or tracked vehicle
- You see small lateral position drift on straight runs
- Your `VY` state doesn't stay near zero between encoder updates

Switch to `Ackermann` if:
- Your robot has front-wheel steering (car-like, forklift, outdoor field robot)
- The lateral constraint is the same as `DifferentialDrive`; `wheelbase` is stored for future minimum-turning-radius enforcement

Do not use `DifferentialDrive` or `Ackermann` for:
- Aerial vehicles (no lateral constraint applies)
- Holonomic (mecanum) platforms (those can move sideways intentionally)

## Wait for all sensors: replacing sleep() in launch files

A common pattern in ROS launch files is `sleep(3)` before starting the navigation stack to give sensors time to come online. This is fragile -- on a slow machine the sensors might need 5 seconds, and on a fast one you waste 3 seconds on every launch.

`init.wait_for_all_sensors: true` replaces this entirely. FusionCore holds initialization until it has seen at least one message from every sensor you configured. Then it starts. No sleep needed.

```yaml
init.wait_for_all_sensors: true
init.sensor_wait_timeout: 10.0
```

The timeout is a safety net: if a sensor fails to start, the filter does not hang forever. It logs which sensors were missing and starts anyway:

```
[WARN] Sensor wait timed out after 10.0s. Missing: [GNSS]. Starting anyway.
```

This is especially useful at competition startup, on-site robot power-on, or any deployment where sensor initialization order is not guaranteed.

---

## Deterministic replay: debugging without hardware

See [How It Works -- Deterministic replay](how-it-works.md#deterministic-replay-and-state-checkpoints) for the full workflow. Quick reference:

```bash
# Save filter state at any point during bag replay
ros2 service call /fusioncore/save_checkpoint std_srvs/srv/Trigger

# Restore that state instantly (no need to replay from the beginning)
ros2 service call /fusioncore/load_checkpoint std_srvs/srv/Trigger
```

The checkpoint file path is set by `replay.checkpoint_path` (default `/tmp/fusioncore_checkpoint.txt`).

---

## GPS without a fix (indoor / no GPS)

Set `reference.use_first_fix: false` and leave reference coords at 0.0. The filter starts at the origin and runs on IMU + wheel odometry alone. No GPS topics needed.

---

## Agricultural RTK (UTM output)

Some RTK receivers output easting/northing directly:

```yaml
input.gnss_crs: "EPSG:32617"        # UTM zone 17N (adjust for your zone)
output.crs: "EPSG:32617"
output.convert_to_enu_at_reference: false
reference.use_first_fix: true
```

---

!!! warning "Upgrading from an older config"
    If your YAML has `ukf.q_orientation: 0.01`, change it to `1.0e-9` or delete the line. The old value corrupts quaternion math at typical IMU rates and causes yaw drift and Z-axis rise in simulation.
