## Install

### **Option A: From source** (ROS 2 Jazzy on Ubuntu 24.04 or Humble on Ubuntu 22.04):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src && cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/manankharwar/fusioncore.git
cd ~/ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash  # or /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build --packages-up-to fusioncore_ros
source install/setup.bash
```

**Verify it works** (single command, replaces the 4-terminal manual test):

```bash
bash tools/quick_test.sh
```

Starts FusionCore with fake sensors and checks all outputs in about 15 seconds. Prints `[PASS]` / `[FAIL]` for each check.

### **Option B: Docker (no ROS install required)**

The easiest way to try FusionCore — no ROS 2 installation needed. The image is hosted on GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull ghcr.io/manankharwar/fusioncore:latest

# Quick test (15 seconds, no hardware)
docker run --rm ghcr.io/manankharwar/fusioncore:latest bash tools/quick_test.sh

# Interactive shell
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/manankharwar/fusioncore:latest bash

# Run with your own YAML config + topic remaps
docker run --rm -it --net=host \
  -v ~/my_robot.yaml:/config/robot.yaml:ro \
  ghcr.io/manankharwar/fusioncore:latest \
  ros2 launch fusioncore_ros fusioncore.launch.py \
    fusioncore_config:=/config/robot.yaml \
    --ros-args \
    -r /imu/data:=/your/imu/topic \
    -r /gnss/fix:=/your/gps/topic
```

## Works on the hardware you actually have

Most sensor fusion tutorials assume clean data. Real robots don't have clean data. FusionCore was built around the problems you actually run into.

| The problem | How FusionCore handles it |
|---|---|
| **IMU calibration is approximate** | Gyro and accel bias are filter states, estimated continuously. `init.stationary_window: 2.0` estimates startup bias before motion begins, dropping startup drift from ~10 cm to under 1 cm. |
| **Extrinsic calibration is never exact** | Reads `frame_id` from every IMU message and looks up the TF rotation to `base_link` automatically. Set `imu.frame_id` to override broken frame names from drivers (e.g. Gazebo TurtleBot3). No manual rotation matrices. |
| **Timestamp jitter and zero-stamped drivers** | `dt` is clamped to prevent divergence from missed timer ticks. Wall clock fallback for drivers that publish `stamp={sec=0}`. |
| **GPS arrives late (50–200 ms)** | IMU ring buffer replays 1 second of buffered updates when a delayed fix arrives. The state at the GPS timestamp is reconstructed exactly, not approximated. |
| **Wheel odometry is noisy or slipping** | Adaptive noise covariance updates from the innovation sequence. GPS velocity fusion (optional) compares GPS-reported speed against wheel speed every cycle: the innovation reveals slip and the Kalman gain down-weights the slipping wheel automatically. |
| **Noise parameters require days of tuning** | Two numbers from your IMU datasheet: `imu.gyro_noise` (ARW) and `imu.accel_noise` (VRW). Everything else adapts within the first minute of operation. |
| **Robot runs on Raspberry Pi or Jetson** | Under 0.2 ms per cycle on i7. Under 1 ms on Raspberry Pi 4. Same binary on ARM (NEON auto-detected) and x86 (AVX auto-detected) via Eigen. No recompilation, no parameter changes. |
| **Two IMUs on the platform** | Set `imu2.topic` to fuse a second IMU as an independent measurement. No pre-merging with `imu_filter_madgwick` needed. |
| **GPS drops out in tunnels or canopy** | Inertial coast mode maintains position integrity during sustained GPS dropout. Outlier gate relaxes automatically to reacquire when GPS returns. |
| **Robot sits still for minutes** | ZUPT (zero velocity update) fuses a zero-velocity pseudo-measurement when encoder speed and angular rate are both below threshold. Prevents IMU noise from integrating into position drift during idle periods. |

## Benchmark

FusionCore vs robot_localization on the [NCLT dataset](http://robots.engin.umich.edu/nclt/): same IMU + wheel odometry + GPS, no manual tuning. Twelve full-length sequences across all seasons. RL-EKF run with chi-squared-equivalent thresholds at 99.9% confidence.

| Sequence | Season | Duration | FC ATE RMSE | RL-EKF ATE RMSE | Winner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2012-01-08 | Winter | 92 min | **18.6 m** | 41.2 m | FC +55% |
| 2012-02-04 | Winter | 77 min | **49.7 m** | 265.5 m | FC +81% |
| 2012-03-31 | Spring | 87 min | **22.0 m** | 156.5 m | FC +86% |
| 2012-05-11 | Spring | 84 min | **9.7 m** | 11.5 m | FC +16% |
| 2012-06-15 | Summer | 55 min | 49.2 m | **18.2 m** | RL +63% |
| 2012-08-20 | Summer | 83 min | 98.3 m | **10.6 m** | RL +89% |
| 2012-09-28 | Fall | 77 min | **22.4 m** | 53.8 m | FC +58% |
| 2012-10-28 | Fall | 85 min | **15.6 m** | 56.4 m | FC +72% |
| 2012-11-04 | Fall | 79 min | **60.1 m** | 122.0 m | FC +51% |
| 2012-12-01 | Winter | 75 min | **21.0 m** | 90.7 m | FC +77% |
| 2013-02-23 | Winter | 78 min | **59.4 m** | 82.2 m | FC +28% |
| 2013-04-05 | Spring | 68 min | **12.1 m** | 268.9 m | FC +96% |

> **Note:** these numbers are a snapshot pending a controlled full-suite re-run on current `main`. The 10/12 result holds, but the 2013-04-05 figure (12.1 m) is stale: it has since regressed to ~19.4 m (still a 93% win). See `tools/benchmark_regression.md`.

RL-UKF diverges with NaN on all twelve sequences. FusionCore wins 10/12 sequences. RL-EKF's losses trace to a single root cause: the GPS driver reports 3m sigma, but measured against RTK ground truth, actual p95 noise is 9.7-53.1m depending on the day. RL's gate is calibrated to the stated 3m and rejects valid fixes on bad-GPS days. FusionCore's adaptive noise estimation (`adaptive.gnss: true`) keeps chi2 statistics calibrated in real time.

The two FC losses are driven by a GPS data quality issue on 2012-08-20 (105 corrupt mode-3 fixes in a 24-second window at a blackout boundary) and accumulated heading error during a 462-second GPS blackout on 2012-06-15. See [benchmarks/README.md](benchmarks/README.md) for full per-sequence analysis including root causes and path-to-fix.

## Used on real hardware

Real engineers, real robots, real sensor data. Not demos.

> "The system was stable on real robot data and was relatively easy to configure. I was able to get reasonable behavior without spending excessive time on parameter tuning. The overall experience felt more deployment-oriented than research-demo-oriented."

## In the ecosystem

**rtabmap_ros (merged):** FusionCore is included as a named demo in the official [rtabmap_ros](https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap_ros) repository, maintained by @matlabbe. The demo ("Turtlebot3 Nav2, 2D LiDAR SLAM with FusionCore") shows FusionCore and icp_odometry running in a feedback loop: FusionCore's stable odom frame seeds scan matching via `guess_frame_id`, and the ICP result feeds back into FusionCore as a second velocity source. [View the demo](https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap_ros/tree/ros2/rtabmap_demos)

**Stereolabs community:** FusionCore + ZED integration guide posted on the Stereolabs developer forum, acknowledged by Stereolabs support. Under active evaluation by [@privvyledge](https://github.com/privvyledge) comparing FusionCore against Wolf, TIER IV EagleEye, and robot_localization on two platforms: an F1/10 scale car (indoor, VESC + RealSense D435i) and a full-size autonomous van (GPS + ZED 2i + 360 LiDAR).

**OpenMowerNext (integration in progress):** FusionCore is being integrated as the localization stack in [OpenMowerNext](https://github.com/jkaflik/OpenMowerNext), a community ROS 2 autonomous mowing system. The integration replaces robot_localization with a single FusionCore lifecycle node fusing RTK GPS (u-blox F9P), IMU, and wheel odometry, with ECEF datum calculated from the mower's home position.

## Switching from robot_localization?

FusionCore is a drop-in replacement for the robot_localization + navsat_transform stack. The migration guide covers the YAML and launch file changes: [manankharwar.github.io/fusioncore/migration_from_robot_localization](https://manankharwar.github.io/fusioncore/migration_from_robot_localization/)

The architectural differences that matter in practice:

| Problem | How FusionCore handles it |
|---|---|
| GPS outliers corrupt the state | Chi-squared gate per sensor DOF rejects bad fixes before they reach the filter. Covariance bounded at every step — no NaN divergence. |
| UTM zone boundary near the operating area | GPS fused directly in ECEF. No UTM projection, no zone boundary edge case. |
| Wheeled robot drifts laterally without GPS | Non-holonomic constraint (NHC) zeros lateral and vertical velocity as a virtual measurement on every encoder update. |
| GPS fixes arrive 50–200 ms late | IMU ring buffer with retrodiction. Late fixes replay missed IMU steps and reconstruct the exact filter state at the GPS timestamp. |
| Bag replay gives different results each run | Message timestamps drive all updates under `use_sim_time: true`. Same bag, same config, identical output. |
| IMU mounted off-axis or with a broken frame name | TF lookup on every message. `imu.frame_id` override for drivers that publish wrong frame names. |
| navsat_transform node adds CPU load and startup ordering complexity | No navsat_transform node. ECEF conversion is one matrix multiply per GPS fix inside the filter. |
