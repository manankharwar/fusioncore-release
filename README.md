# FusionCore

**ROS 2 sensor fusion SDK. Combines IMU, wheel encoders, and GPS into one reliable position estimate. Zero manual tuning. Apache 2.0.**

---

## What problem does this solve?

Every mobile robot needs to know where it is. It gets this from multiple sensors: IMU, wheel encoders, GPS: each of which is imperfect in its own way. IMUs drift. Wheels slip. GPS jumps. You need software that intelligently combines all three into one trustworthy position estimate.

That software is called a sensor fusion package. The standard one for ROS, `robot_localization`, was officially deprecated in September 2023. Its designated replacement (`fuse`) still doesn't support GPS properly as of early 2026. At ROSCon UK 2025 the official workshop was still teaching both tools because no clear accessible replacement existed.

FusionCore is that replacement.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- ROS 2 Jazzy Jalisco
- A colcon workspace (`~/ros2_ws`)

### Clone into your workspace
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/manankharwar/fusioncore.git
cd ~/ros2_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build --packages-select fusioncore_core fusioncore_ros
source install/setup.bash
```

---

## Running the tests
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
colcon build --packages-select fusioncore_core --cmake-args -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
colcon test --packages-select fusioncore_core
colcon test-result --verbose
```

Expected output: `42 tests, 0 errors, 0 failures, 0 skipped`

---

## Running FusionCore

```bash
# Terminal 1
ros2 launch fusioncore_ros fusioncore.launch.py

# Terminal 2
ros2 lifecycle set /fusioncore configure
ros2 lifecycle set /fusioncore activate

# Verify
ros2 topic hz /fusion/odom
# expected: average rate: 100.000
```

FusionCore uses a ROS 2 lifecycle node. Configure first (load parameters, validate TF tree, check transforms), then activate (start processing sensor data). This prevents the filter from starting with bad initial values or missing transforms.

> **WSL2 note:** If `ros2 lifecycle set` returns "Node not found", use the launch file's built-in auto-configure instead. The Gazebo launch file (`fusioncore_gazebo.launch.py`) configures and activates the node automatically via `EmitEvent(ChangeState(...))` 12 seconds after startup, bypassing DDS discovery latency that affects WSL2.

## How FusionCore handles the hard problems

### IMU frame transform

IMUs are almost never mounted at `base_link`. FusionCore reads `frame_id` from every IMU message, looks up the TF rotation to `base_link`, and rotates angular velocity and linear acceleration before fusing. If the transform is missing you get the exact command to fix it:

```
[WARN] Cannot transform IMU from imu_link to base_link.
Fix: ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 base_link imu_link
```

### TF validation at startup

During `configure`, FusionCore checks that all required TF transforms exist before the filter starts. Missing transforms print the exact fix command: no silent failures, no mysterious drift:

```
--- TF Validation ---
  [OK]      imu_link -> base_link
  [MISSING] base_link -> odom  Fix: ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 odom base_link
---------------------
```

### Mahalanobis outlier rejection

Before fusing any GPS fix, FusionCore computes how statistically implausible the measurement is given the current state estimate. The Mahalanobis distance `d² = νᵀ · S⁻¹ · ν` is compared against chi-squared thresholds at the 99.9th percentile. Fixes that exceed the threshold are rejected without updating the filter.

This handles GPS jumps, multipath errors, and encoder slip spikes. The filter position stays stable during rejection: verified by injecting a 1km GPS jump in testing and observing zero position change.

### Adaptive noise covariance

robot_localization requires manually tuning noise covariance matrices in YAML. Getting these wrong causes the filter to be overconfident or underconfident.

FusionCore tracks a sliding window of 50 innovation sequences per sensor and estimates the actual noise covariance from the data. The noise matrix R is slowly updated toward the estimated true value using an exponential moving average with `alpha=0.01`. After a few minutes of operation, R converges to the real sensor characteristics automatically.

### GPS antenna offset (lever arm)

If the GPS antenna is not at `base_link`: mounted on top of the robot, forward of center: its readings correspond to a different trajectory than `base_link`. Ignoring this injects position errors proportional to lever arm length times rotation rate.

FusionCore corrects for this using the rotation matrix from the current state: `p_antenna = p_base + R * lever_arm`. But this correction depends on heading: if heading is wrong the correction makes things worse. So FusionCore only activates lever arm correction when heading has been **independently validated** from a real source.

### Heading observability

A Kalman filter can reduce its own uncertainty about heading even when it has no real heading sensor: it does this by fitting the motion model to GPS position updates. The variance goes down, but the heading might still be wrong. Using that fake confidence to activate lever arm correction can destabilize the filter.

FusionCore tracks a `heading_validated_` flag that is only set true from a genuine independent source:

- **`DUAL_ANTENNA`**: dual antenna heading message received
- **`IMU_ORIENTATION`**: 9-axis AHRS published full orientation (only when `imu.has_magnetometer: true`: 6-axis IMUs drift in yaw and don't count)
- **`GPS_TRACK`**: robot has traveled >= 5 meters at speed >= 0.2 m/s with yaw rate <= 0.3 rad/s (geometrically observable, not just accumulated distance or GPS jitter)

Before any of these, lever arm is disabled regardless of what yaw variance says. The filter cannot fake its way into applying the correction.

### Message covariances

FusionCore uses the covariance values sensors actually publish rather than ignoring them.

**GPS:** When `position_covariance_type == 3`, the full 3x3 covariance matrix is used including off-diagonal elements. RTK receivers in particular publish meaningful off-diagonal terms. Falls back to HDOP/VDOP scaling otherwise. Config params always available as override for sensors with bogus covariance.

**Wheel odometry:** Reads `twist.covariance` per-axis when available. A wheel-slip estimating odometry node that publishes real covariances gets the benefit automatically.

**IMU orientation:** Reads `orientation_covariance` from the message. Uses it directly when meaningful, falls back to config params when not.

### Non-holonomic ground constraint

For wheeled ground robots, FusionCore fuses a `VZ = 0` pseudo-measurement on every encoder update. This prevents vertical velocity from drifting due to IMU noise and keeps altitude estimation stable even when GPS has weak vertical observability.

Call `update_ground_constraint(timestamp)` after every `update_encoder()` call in your integration. Do not call this for aerial vehicles or robots that can move vertically.

### Sensor dropout detection

FusionCore tracks the last update time for each sensor independently. If a sensor goes silent for longer than `stale_timeout` (default 1.0 second), `get_status()` returns `SensorHealth::STALE` for that sensor. The filter continues running on the remaining sensors and recovers automatically when the missing sensor resumes. This is reported via `FusionCoreStatus` so your application can alert the operator or take action without polling every topic individually.

### compass_msgs/Azimuth

peci1 (Great Contributor, ROS Discourse) suggested using `compass_msgs/Azimuth` as a standard heading message format. The upstream package is ROS 1 only. FusionCore ships a ROS 2 native port with the identical message definition.

FusionCore accepts `compass_msgs/Azimuth` on a configurable topic, handles ENU/NED convention conversion, RAD/DEG units, and warns when magnetic north reference is used instead of geographic.

### Delay compensation

GPS messages arrive 100-300ms after the fix was taken. Without compensation, delayed fixes are silently dropped: the filter's clock has already moved past that timestamp.

FusionCore saves a full state snapshot (21-dimensional state + covariance) on every IMU update at 100Hz: 50 snapshots = 0.5 seconds of history. When a delayed GPS fix arrives, it finds the closest snapshot before the fix timestamp, restores that state, applies the fix at the correct time, then re-predicts forward to now.

This is approximate retrodiction: the re-prediction uses the motion model rather than replaying actual IMU history. For smooth motion at normal robot speeds the approximation error is small compared to GPS noise. Full IMU replay retrodiction is on the roadmap.

**Update:** Full IMU replay retrodiction is now implemented. Every raw IMU message is stored in a ring buffer (configurable size, default 100 messages = 1 second at 100Hz). When a delayed GPS fix arrives, FusionCore restores the closest snapshot before the fix timestamp, re-fuses the fix at the correct time, then replays all buffered IMU messages forward to now rather than using one big predict(dt). This eliminates the motion-model approximation error for delayed measurements entirely.

## Simulation

FusionCore ships with a Gazebo Harmonic simulation world so you can test the full fusion pipeline without physical hardware. It includes a differential drive robot with a 100Hz IMU and GPS, in an outdoor environment with the GPS origin set to Hamilton, Ontario.

One thing worth knowing up front: Gazebo Harmonic's built-in NavSat sensor has a known bug (gz-sim issue #2163) where it periodically outputs GPS fixes at completely wrong coordinates: sometimes 100km away. Rather than fight a broken sensor, the simulation derives GPS from Gazebo's ground truth world pose and adds realistic Gaussian noise (0.5m horizontal, 0.3m vertical 1-sigma). This gives you a clean, honest GPS model for testing the filter.

### Running the simulation

If you haven\'t built yet, add `fusioncore_gazebo` to the build command from the Installation section:
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
colcon build --packages-select fusioncore_gazebo
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch fusioncore_gazebo fusioncore_gazebo.launch.py
```

Launch everything: Gazebo, the ROS bridge, and FusionCore all start together and auto-configure after 12 seconds:
```bash
ros2 launch fusioncore_gazebo fusioncore_gazebo.launch.py
```

Drive the robot and watch the fused position:
```bash
# Terminal 2: drive forward
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 0.5}, angular: {z: 0.3}}" --rate 10

# Terminal 3: watch position
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 topic echo /fusion/odom --field pose.pose.position
```

### Integration tests

Four automated tests verify the full stack: IMU drift rate, outlier rejection, GPS correction after drift, and full circle return. Run them while the simulation is up:
```bash
python3 ~/ros2_ws/src/fusioncore/fusioncore_gazebo/launch/integration_test.py
```

All four pass on a clean session.

- In Gazebo simulation, residual y-axis drift (~0.3m) can occur from real Gazebo physics (wheel contact forces, slight crabbing). This is not a filter error: the robot's true center of mass drifts relative to the GPS-derived ENU origin.

**Roadmap:**
- Ackermann and omnidirectional steering motion models
