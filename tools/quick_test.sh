# Starts the filter with fake sensors and checks that all expected outputs

#   bash tools/quick_test.sh
#
# Requirements:
#   FusionCore built in this workspace:
#     colcon build --packages-up-to fusioncore_ros
#   OR use the Docker container:
#     docker run --rm ghcr.io/manankharwar/fusioncore:latest bash tools/quick_test.sh
