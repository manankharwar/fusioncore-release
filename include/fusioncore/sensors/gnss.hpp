// How to measure: use a tape measure from your robot's base_link origin
// (usually center of the rear axle or geometric center) to the antenna.

//   lever_arm_x = 0.0   (centered fore-aft)

  //
  // Those are two different quantities and conflating them is why the gate does
  // not fire. A receiver's reported covariance describes ABSOLUTE accuracy, the
  // multipath and ionospheric error that moves slowly; consecutive fixes are far
  // more consistent than that number implies. Measured on the 2026-09-06 rover
  // log: 3.24 m declared, 0.171 m median second difference, a factor of 55.
  //
  // The update wants the absolute figure, or the filter will believe GPS to
  // centimetres it has not earned and track that slow bias rigidly. The gate
  // wants the short-term figure, because an outlier IS a break in short-term
  // consistency. With the absolute figure in both places, S is so large that no
  // realistic spike looks surprising: on that log a spike had to exceed 29 m
  // before it was rejected, and an accepted 15 m spike moved position 4.5 m.
  //
  // Estimate it from a bag with tools/nis_from_bag.py, which reports the
  // fix-to-fix second difference for exactly this purpose. Set it a little
  // generously: too small and ordinary noise gets rejected, which is the failure
  // mode that has bitten this project repeatedly.
  double outlier_sigma_xy = 0.0;

  // Largest plausible SECOND DIFFERENCE between consecutive fixes, in METRES.
  // Zero (the default) disables the check.
  //
  // This exists because the chi2 gate structurally cannot see a metre-scale
  // spike. That gate tests a fix against the FILTER, so its scale is
  // S = H P H' + R, tens of square metres for a consumer receiver, and on the
  // 2026-09-06 rover log a spike had to exceed 29 m before it was rejected while
  // an accepted 15 m spike moved position 4.5 m. Neither a better gate R nor a
  // perfect heading fixes that: heading actually made it slightly worse.
  //
  // Continuity asks a different question, one that never touches P: does this fix
  // agree with where the last few put it? A least-squares line through the last
  // five accepted fixes predicts the next one, and a spike breaks that badly.
  // Measured on the same log, the median residual of a good fix is 0.171 m, so a
  // 10 m spike is roughly 58 times the normal scale. Invisible to chi2,
  // unmissable here.
  //
  // WHY FIVE POINTS AND NOT TWO. A two-point extrapolation puts an error in the
  // newest reference point into the prediction multiplied by about two, so a
  // spike small enough to pass this limit threw the NEXT good fix over it: the
  // gate kept the bad sample and rejected the good one, which is worse than not
  // gating. Over five points the weight on the newest is 0.8, so a spike that
  // passes can only move the next prediction by 0.8 of itself and can never
  // reach the limit, whatever the limit is set to.
  //
  // HOW TO SET IT. Above the p99 of the residual your own receiver produces, not
  // by feel. The cost of being wrong is rejecting good fixes, which is the
  // failure that has cost this project most, and an accepted spike of a few
  // metres does very little damage anyway: measured on the 2026-09-07 log, an
  // accepted 3 m spike moved the trajectory 0.25 m while an accepted 60 m spike
  // moved it 15.73 m. The gate earns its keep in the tail, so set it to catch
  // the tail and leave ordinary noise alone.
  //
  // Measured across 1287 fixes from six 2026-09 rover logs: median residual 0.18
  // to 0.59 m, p99 0.95 to 3.00 m, largest 3.81 m. At 4.0 there were no
  // rejections at all on clean data and every injected spike from 4 m up was
  // caught, so 4.0 is the right number FOR THAT RECEIVER. Measure yours.
  double continuity_max_m = 0.0;

  // When continuity_max_m is left at 0, measure the threshold from this
  // receiver instead of leaving the gate off.
  //
  // Off was the old behaviour and it meant the out-of-box filter could not see a
  // metre-scale spike at all, because chi2 is the only other gate and it tests
  // against the filter's own covariance: measured on the 2026-09-06 rover log, a
  // spike had to exceed 29 m before chi2 rejected it, while an accepted 15 m
  // spike moved position 4.5 m. Meanwhile the right threshold was sitting in the
  // data the whole time, since it is a property of the receiver.
  //
  // The filter watches the first CONT_LEARN_N admissible fixes, takes the
  // largest prediction residual it sees, and sets the limit to 1.5x that,
  // clamped to [2, 25] m. An explicit continuity_max_m always wins and skips
  // learning entirely. The value chosen is logged and published.
  //
  // ON by default as of the continuity-buffer fix. It was off while the gate
