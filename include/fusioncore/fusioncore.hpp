  // same defect that has bitten every absolute-threshold GNSS gate in this
  // project. Standing still is the one moment in a run where the filter can
  // check a sensor against evidence instead of against a tuned constant,
  // because every fix is then sampling the SAME physical point. Two things get
  // measured from those fixes, per axis:
  //
  //   1. MAGNITUDE. Their spread is the receiver's real short-term sigma. Divide
  //      by the sigma it declares and square: a receiver that is as good as it
  //      claims scores 1 and is left alone.
  //
  //   2. CORRELATION, and this one is usually the larger of the two. A Kalman
  //      filter assumes measurement errors are white, so N fixes of a fixed
  //      point shrink its uncertainty like sqrt(N). GNSS error is not white:
  //      multipath, ionosphere and satellite geometry drift over minutes, so
  //      consecutive fixes are largely the same error repeated. Measure the
  //      lag-1 autocorrelation r of the parked fixes and the honest effective
  //      sample size is N(1-r)/(1+r), so R has to carry a factor (1+r)/(1-r) for
  //      the filter's own posterior to mean what it says. At the 0.95 to 0.99
  //      typical of a parked consumer receiver at 1 Hz, that alone is 39x to
  //      199x, and it is why a hand-picked 100 happened to work.
  //
  // The applied inflation is the product, capped here. So this number bounds how
  // far one bad parked window can push the filter and does NOT decide the
  // amount, and there is nothing to retune per environment or per receiver.
  //
  // Note that (2) fires for an honest receiver too, and should: an RTK unit
  // reporting a correct 2 cm sigma still has errors correlated over minutes, so
  // a filter that parks for a minute and averages 60 of them ends up far more
  // confident than the geometry supports, and carries that over-confidence into
  // the next leg. That is a general defect, not a bad-receiver defect.

  // fused drift down from 10.16 m, but no further than 1.64 m mean across 11
  // parked windows, because the filter still weighed that receiver by its own
  // stated covariance.

  //     2026-09-05, 27 s,  8.83 m             0.72   <- the one that matters
  // A first attempt at 0.70 would have FIRED on that third window and disabled
  // the idle-drift fix on a robot that was sitting still. A robot genuinely
  // driving on dead encoders tracks close to 1.0, so 0.85 leaves room on both

  // noisier IMU than this one. The measured value is published as
  // zupt_accel_std so a user can pick their own from their own data.
