## [0.3.7]: 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- **The UKF centre sigma weight was -99, and the filter drove backwards.** At 23 states with the previous `ukf.alpha` default of 0.1 and `kappa = 0`, `lambda = alpha^2*n - n = -22.77`, giving a centre weight of **-99.0** against 46 outer weights of +2.17. They sum to 1, so it is formally correct, but only for a tight sigma-point cluster. Yaw is structurally unobservable without an absolute heading source, so the quaternion sigma points spread wide, their forward displacements cancel one another, and what survives is the centre point (the one pointing correctly forward) multiplied by -99. The filter then moved position BACKWARDS while reporting a perfect velocity and a perfect heading, which is why this presented for months as "velocity right, position wrong" and resisted every covariance and process-noise explanation. Measured with a perfect encoder at 1.0 m/s over 60 s against a truth of 60.00 m: `alpha 0.1` gave **-114.06 m**, `alpha 0.5` gave 8.83 m, `alpha 1.0` gives 48.43 m. It is entirely the predict step: predict moved position -114.89 m where it should have moved +58.77, while every measurement update combined contributed 12 mm. Validated on real data, NCLT 2013-04-05 at 1x playback: **5268.80 m ATE to 131.85 m, a 97.5% reduction**, with robot_localization unchanged at ~230 m across all runs as the control. `alpha = 1.0` gives `lambda = 0` and all 47 weights non-negative, which is the standard unscaled UKF; with `kappa = 0` any alpha below 1 makes the centre weight negative, so lowering alpha to "tighten" the spread does the opposite of what it does in a low-dimensional filter. No shipped config overrode `ukf.alpha`, so every user was running -99. Reproductions in `tools/repro/`.

  Two caveats stated plainly. This does **not** fully restore the 22.96 m that commit `c8b8b1f` (19 May) measures on the same machine, so a second regression remains unidentified: alpha was the dominant cause, not the only one. And only 2013-04-05 has been re-measured; every other entry in `tools/benchmark_baseline.json` predates this fix.

- **`MagnetometerTest.BoundsHeadingDriftFromSlipDuringBlackout` asserted the bug.** Its "heading runs away without a magnetometer" threshold of 0.5 rad was calibrated against a filter with `Wm[0] = -99`. The same gyro bias and encoder slip now produce 0.41 rad, so the threshold moved to 0.3. The two assertions that actually prove the magnetometer's value, the absolute bound and the >80% reduction, are unchanged and still pass.

### Changed
- **The certified configs now say which GNSS quality gate actually runs.** `bosch-bno085-ublox-f9p-outdoor`, `microstrain-3dm-gx3-45-segway` and `xsens-mti-680g-fsae` all listed `gnss.max_hdop` as though it were the gate. Since 0.3.6 a fix carrying a `position_covariance` is gated on the receiver's reported sigma in metres and the DOP thresholds are never consulted, which for these three receivers is always. Each config now states that, and points at the sigma gate with a note to leave it at its permissive defaults unless the receiver's actual reported sigma has been logged: a gate tuned to clean-sky numbers throws away the degraded fixes you most need.
- `tools/run_nclt.sh` runs one NCLT sequence end to end with the process hygiene the harness needs (no orphaned players competing for CPU, no recorder appending to the next run's bag, a refusal to run off a 9p mount) and prints the achieved filter rate next to the ATE, because a starved run's ATE is meaningless. `tools/repro/blackout.cpp` now sweeps `ukf.alpha` instead of `gnss_coast_q_bias_factor`, which measured as a dead knob: identical results at 100 and at 1 under both the old and the new default.

---

## [0.3.6]: 2026-08-12

### Fixed
- **GNSS quality gate compared metres against thresholds named as DOP, silently rejecting good fixes (issue #73).** `sensor_msgs/NavSatFix` carries no DOP fields, so the node derives fix quality from `position_covariance` as `sqrt(variance)`, which is **metres**. That value was then compared against `gnss.max_hdop` (default 4.0) and `gnss.max_vdop` (default 6.0), parameters everyone reads as the dimensionless geometry factor where 4.0 is a permissive limit. What the defaults actually meant was "reject any fix worse than 4 m horizontal or 6 m vertical", which a standalone receiver fails constantly. Measured on 500 real fixes from a u-blox NEO-M9N outdoor run: horizontal sigma 3.6 to 6.0 m, vertical 14.4 to 24.0 m, so **all 500 fixes were rejected at the shipped defaults** and the filter dead-reckoned the entire run. Nothing surfaced this beyond a throttled log line naming a parameter that was the wrong units to begin with. `GnssFix` now carries explicit `sigma_xy` / `sigma_z` in metres, set whenever the fix has a covariance, and the gate reads those against the new `gnss.max_sigma_xy` (25.0) and `gnss.max_sigma_z` (50.0). `max_hdop` / `max_vdop` keep their original meaning and apply only when the fix has no covariance, which in practice means `gps_msgs/GPSFix` reporting receiver-native DOP. Accepted fixes are fused exactly as before: replaying the same 500-fix bag gives a bit-identical trajectory (loop closure 2.62 m, path 219.61 m). The bundled `env_urban`, `env_canopy` and `env_open` configs now express their intent in metres.
- **`/fusion/debug/gnss_status` reported `NOT_PROCESSED` for two real rejection causes.** The enum-to-string mapper feeding that topic had no case for `IMPLAUSIBLE_JUMP`, so it fell through `default` and published `NOT_PROCESSED`, the value meaning "update_gnss was never called". Anyone watching the topic saw fixes disappear with no stated cause, including our own field monitoring during a 500-fix run where 157 fixes were rejected by the jump gate. The mapper is now exhaustive and covers the two new sigma reasons as well.

- **The `gnss.max_speed` jump gate rejected ordinary GPS noise as an impossible jump.** The bound was `max_speed * gap + max_speed_margin`, entirely absolute metres. At 1 Hz with `max_speed: 2.0` and the default 5 m margin that is a 7 m bound, and a standalone receiver whose own reported sigma is ~6 m trips it constantly. Measured on a real run: **157 of 500 good fixes rejected, loop closure 2.62 m to 7.27 m**, on a rover whose actual top speed is 0.6 m/s, so no honest motion was ever involved. The bound now adds `gnss.max_speed_sigma_k` (default 5.0) multiples of the receiver's reported horizontal sigma. Replaying the same bag with the gate enabled at 2.0: **0 of 500 rejected, closure 2.62 m, identical to having the gate disabled**, so the gate no longer costs anything on good data. The noise term scales with the RECEIVER's sigma and deliberately not with the filter's covariance: chi2 is already the covariance-scaled test, and this gate exists to catch what a coast-inflated chi2 admits, so scaling it by `P` would reopen the hole it was built to plug. A test pins that property by checking the verdict on the same outlier is unchanged after a 1 s gap and a 10 s coast.

- **GPS track heading fought better heading sources and ignored its own motion gates (issue #73).** Track heading derives yaw from the GPS displacement bearing, which is course over ground. On a curved path that differs from body heading by a real bias, not just noise, so fusing it pulls the estimate wrong no matter how honest its covariance is. Two things were wrong. It ran even when a stronger absolute heading source was already active (dual antenna, magnetometer, or a 9-axis IMU orientation), all of which the `heading_source_` ladder already ranks above it. And `gps_track_heading_min_speed` / `gps_track_heading_max_yaw_rate`, documented since they were introduced as guarding this fusion, only ever gated `distance_traveled_` and the `heading_validated_` flag inside `update_distance_traveled()`: the fusion itself ran unguarded, so a slow, turning robot fused its turn radius as a heading. Reported by a user whose Nav2 path was straight without GPS and a zig-zag with it, on a robot with a stable magnetometer: with 2 m of GPS noise over the 5 m default baseline the fused heading carried 0.4 rad (23 degrees) of uncertainty, right at the `max_sigma` limit, and was competing with a magnetometer an order of magnitude better. Both guards are now applied to the fusion, and `GnssFixDebug` carries `track_heading_skipped_stronger_source` / `track_heading_skipped_motion` so a skip is visible rather than silent. Robots with no absolute heading source are unaffected: track heading remains their heading, pinned by a regression test.

### Added
- **`gnss.max_speed_sigma_k`** (default 5.0), the receiver-noise term in the jump-gate bound. See above.
- **`gnss.max_sigma_xy` and `gnss.max_sigma_z`**, the quality gate in metres of reported one-sigma. See above.
- **`SIGMA_XY_HIGH` and `SIGMA_Z_HIGH` rejection reasons**, so the reported cause names the gate that actually fired and the parameter to change. The GNSS rejection warning now prints the value, its units, and the limit it failed against.
- Eight tests pinning the two gates: the exact case from issue #73 (a 2 m / 8 m fix must be accepted), a regression guard that the DOP path still applies when no covariance is present, ordinary 6 m-sigma noise surviving the jump gate, a 700 m spike still rejected on that same noisy receiver, and the jump bound staying independent of filter covariance. The four pre-existing coast tests are unchanged, so sustained-spike rejection and post-outage recovery are unaffected. Test count is now 126.

## [0.3.5]: 2026-07-30

Everything here comes from one user field report (issue #73), which is the deepest integration anyone has run against FusionCore: Nav2 GPS waypoint following on real hardware.

### Added
- **A launch test that asserts `/fromLL` is advertised with the type Nav2 binds**, plus unit tests for the stale-rejection policy. The `/fromLL` defect below shipped from v0.2.1 through 0.3.4 with nothing complaining, because the only thing exercising it was a manual `ros2 service call`, which passes the type by hand and therefore always works. The new test starts the real node and checks the advertised type string, then calls the service with a robot_localization-typed client and checks the conversion on both axes. It was mutation-checked: pointed at the old type it fails, so the assertion is live rather than vacuously passing. `test_stale_rate` adds 8 unit tests pinning the two ends apart, from 2 rejections across an hour (quiet) to a 50 Hz sensor rejected wholesale (warns). Test count is now 114.

### Fixed
- **Nav2 GPS waypoint following now works (issue #73).** `followGpsWaypoints` hung forever on `[waypoint_follower]: /fromLL service client: waiting for service to appear...` even though FusionCore was advertising `/fromLL` and a manual `ros2 service call` against it worked. The name matched and the fields matched, but the type did not: FusionCore served `fusioncore_ros/srv/FromLL` while `nav2_waypoint_follower` has `robot_localization::srv::FromLL` compiled into its header (`waypoint_follower.hpp`). ROS 2 matches services on name **and** type, so from Nav2's side the service simply never existed, and because a service client waits rather than failing, nothing anywhere reported a problem. Identical field layout under a different type name is not drop-in compatibility. `/fromLL` is now advertised as `robot_localization/srv/FromLL`, so Nav2's GPS waypoint client binds with no bridge node and no robot_localization node running. This adds `robot_localization` as a dependency of `fusioncore_ros` for that one interface definition: no robot_localization code is linked or executed, `fusioncore_core` is untouched and still depends on nothing but Eigen, and Nav2 already pulls the package in for the same reason, so anyone running GPS waypoints has it regardless. `fusioncore_ros/srv/FromLL` is kept but deprecated and no longer served, so anything built against 0.3.4 or earlier still compiles. Verified live: the service advertises the expected type and converts correctly in both axes (0.0009 deg north returns 99.99 m, 0.0009 deg east returns 73.08 m at latitude 43.26).
- **Fixed a defect in the bundled Nav2 configuration that stopped the robot moving.** `fusioncore_nav2.launch.py` includes nav2_bringup's `navigation_launch.py`, which starts `collision_monitor` unconditionally (Jazzy has no launch argument to disable it) and lifecycle-manages it, while the bundled `nav2_params.yaml` had no `collision_monitor` section. That node refuses to configure without one (`parameter 'observation_sources' is not initialized`), and it sits in the command path, subscribing to `cmd_vel_smoothed` and republishing `cmd_vel`. So planning and control ran correctly, produced velocities, and nothing reached the base. `nav2_params.yaml` now ships a `collision_monitor` section. Since `observation_sources` and `polygons` are both mandatory and an empty list is rejected by the parameter parser, there is no way to declare "no sources"; instead one polygon and one source are declared and disabled, which lets the node activate and pass velocity through untouched. Verified against the shipped file: the node reaches `active` and 0.42 m/s on `cmd_vel_smoothed` comes out of `cmd_vel` unchanged, angular component intact. **This deliberately provides no obstacle protection**, matching the rest of that config which assumes GPS navigation with no map and no lidar; `docs/nav2.md` says so plainly and explains how to enable it properly with a laser. Found by the reporter of issue #73, who had to disable the collision monitor to get Nav2 up at all.
- **The stale-sensor warning reports a rate instead of crying wolf over a count.** It fired on any increase at all, so two dropped samples across an entire run produced the same alarming wall of text as a completely broken clock. That is exactly what happened to the reporter of issue #73, after he had already fixed his real skew. The warning now fires only above 1 rejection per second sustained, states the measured rate, and prints the inter-sensor offset next to the `max_measurement_delay` it is being compared against, so the number that matters and the knob that changes it appear together. Isolated drops go to debug instead. The text now also names both causes, because a lagging stamp is not always a clock problem: real transport latency on a wireless link is indistinguishable from skew at the filter, and the fix for that one is to raise `max_measurement_delay` above the measured offset rather than to touch the drivers.

---

## [0.3.4]: 2026-07-27

Three fixes found by running FusionCore on real hardware: one from a user's field report (issue #73) and two from a self-built GPS test rover. All three share a theme: a sensor stops being fused and nothing says so. Each is now both fixed and visible on `/fusion/debug/filter_health`.

### Fixed
- **Sensors on different clocks no longer make the filter diverge (issue #73).** A field report showed perfect wheel odometry going in and a ~10 m/s position runaway coming out. Root cause: the user's IMU driver stamped messages ~3 s ahead of the encoder's (correct) clock. The filter clock rode the IMU; every encoder message then arrived looking 3 s old; the backward-time-jump guard re-based the clock backward to fuse it; and the next IMU message re-integrated the entire 3 s window forward through the motion model again, at the IMU rate. Re-integrating a 3 s window 50 times per second turns any small velocity estimate into tens of meters per second of divergence. The fix distinguishes the two cases by the sensor's own stream: stamps that still advance while lagging the filter clock mean the sensor is on a slower clock (inter-sensor skew), so the measurement is rejected as stale and counted, keeping the clock monotonic; stamps that jump backward within their own stream mean a genuine time-base reset (bag replay restart, clock correction), which still re-bases exactly as before. Adds `imu_stale_reject_count` and `encoder_stale_reject_count` to `/fusion/debug/filter_health`, a startup warning when a sensor's `header.stamp` is more than 1 s from the node clock, and a throttled runtime warning naming the measured inter-sensor offset when stale rejections climb, so a clock mismatch is called out in plain words instead of failing silently. Adds `test_clock_skew` (3 tests: the reported scenario stays bounded, a true clock reset still re-bases, sub-window latency still fuses).

### Added
- **`max_measurement_delay` parameter.** The retrodiction window and inter-sensor staleness threshold (default 0.5 s, previously hardcoded). Raise it only for a sensor with a genuinely large known latency; if stale rejections climb, fix the sensor clocks instead.
- **`gnss_last_reject_reason` in `/fusion/debug/filter_health`.** When GPS stops fusing, the only question that matters is *why*. The per-fix reason already existed on the `/fusion/debug/gnss_status` firehose, but not on `filter_health`, which is the lightweight one-line dashboard people actually monitor at a glance and record on a field day. That topic reported a single `gnss_outlier_count`, and that counter only increments on chi2 and physical-plausibility rejects: quality-gate rejects (`HDOP_HIGH`, `VDOP_HIGH`, `FIX_TYPE_LOW`, `MIN_SATS`) and `DELAY_TOO_LARGE` never touched it, so a filter silently dropping every fix on vertical DOP looked identical on `filter_health` to one fusing cleanly, and a bag that recorded only `filter_health` (the common case) had no record of why GPS went quiet. The health message now carries the reason string of the most recent rejected fix, so a live `ros2 topic echo` or an offline bag tells you immediately whether to raise `gnss.max_vdop`, check the clock, or accept that a spike was correctly gated. The core exposes it as `FusionCoreStatus::gnss_last_rejection_reason` (a `GnssRejectionReason` enum); no filter behaviour changes. Found while bringing FusionCore up on a real M9N rover, where hours went into a rejection that this one field would have named at a glance. Adds `GNSSTest.RejectionReasonSurfacesInStatus`.
- **`gnss.max_vdop` parameter.** The vertical DOP gate was hardcoded at 6.0 while `gnss.max_hdop` was configurable, an asymmetry with a real cost: a fix can be horizontally excellent yet vertically poor (satellite geometry, sky obstructed by buildings or trees), and a ground robot running `publish.force_2d` does not care about altitude at all. There was no way to stop a good horizontal fix being rejected purely on vertical precision, and the rejection is silent to the filter (`VDOP_HIGH`), so GPS quietly stops fusing in exactly the obstructed-sky conditions where you most need it. `gnss.max_vdop` now mirrors `gnss.max_hdop`, defaulting to the previous 6.0 (no behaviour change) and settable higher (e.g. 20) on a 2D ground robot. Found on real hardware: an M9N indoors reported hdop ~3.3 (accepted) but vdop over 6 (rejected), with the fix otherwise usable.

---

## [0.3.3]: 2026-07-22

### Added
- **`encoder.topic` and `gnss.fix_topic` parameters.** Every optional and secondary input was already configurable (`imu.topic`, `imu2.topic`, `encoder2.topic`, `gnss.fix2_topic`, `gnss.velocity_topic`, and so on), but the two *primary* inputs were hardcoded: wheel odometry on `/odom/wheels` and GPS on `/gnss/fix`. That meant you could rename the second GPS receiver but not the first, and the only way to match your driver's topic was a launch remap, which is the less discoverable of the two mechanisms. Since almost no driver publishes on `/odom/wheels` (the ROS convention is `/odom` or a controller-namespaced variant) nearly every integration hit this, and pointing at the wrong topic fails silently: the filter runs, publishes, and simply never fuses that sensor. Both are now parameters with their previous values as defaults, so existing configs, launch files, and remaps behave exactly as before. `gnss.fix_topic` covers both message types (NavSatFix, or GPSFix when `gnss.use_gps_fix` is true). The node now also logs the IMU, encoder, and GNSS topics it actually subscribed to at startup, so the wiring is verifiable without guessing. The `/odom/wheels` default is kept deliberately: FusionCore publishes its own fused odometry, and defaulting to `/odom` would invite a feedback loop with its own output.
- **`rowcrop_rtk.yaml` config** for outdoor row-crop rovers running RTK GPS + IMU + wheel odometry (weeders, sprayers, scouts, seeders). Sets the RTK noise floor, the physical-plausibility gate (`gnss.max_speed`), gap-gated coast, and GPS-track heading for slow field speeds, and documents the dual-antenna heading options inline. The only per-robot values are the antenna lever arm and the rover's top speed.

### Fixed
- **IMU orientation was silently discarded at startup when the driver left `orientation_covariance` at zero.** The bias window required a strictly positive covariance to accept an orientation, while the runtime path correctly rejected only a negative one. Per the `sensor_msgs/Imu` spec, `-1` means "no orientation data" and all-zeros means "covariance unknown", and plenty of drivers publish a perfectly good quaternion with an unfilled covariance. Those were treated as having no orientation at all, which skipped accelerometer bias initialisation entirely: the bias stayed at zero, so whatever component of gravity the IMU's mounting tilt produced was left in the acceleration channel. A constant acceleration error double-integrates, so position ran away smoothly, reported from the field as roughly 170 m of drift on a 6 m out-and-back with a BNO085. The startup check now matches the runtime check and additionally rejects an all-zero quaternion, which is not a rotation. When no usable orientation is present the log line is now a warning that explains the consequence rather than a quiet info message. Adds `test_imu_orientation_validity` (6 tests) covering the covariance convention and the resulting bias error.
- **`tools/field_record.launch.py` recorded bags with no filter output.** The field-day recording launch started FusionCore with a plain `Node()` and never triggered the lifecycle CONFIGURE transition, so the node sat in `unconfigured` and published nothing. The bag still captured the raw sensor topics, but `/fusion/odom`, `/fusion/debug/gnss_status`, and `/fusion/debug/filter_health` came back empty, which is only discovered after the field day is over. The launch now configures and activates the node, and waits until it is active before starting the recorder so the first seconds of the bag are not missing the `/fusion` topics.
- **`fusioncore.launch.py` and `fusioncore_duatic.launch.py` now bring the node up automatically.** FusionCore is a lifecycle node, but these two launch files started the process and never triggered the initial CONFIGURE transition, so the node sat in `unconfigured` doing nothing: no error, no data, just silence. A first-time user following the README would reasonably conclude FusionCore was broken. Both launch files now emit CONFIGURE and then ACTIVATE, the same pattern `fusioncore_nav2.launch.py` and the Gazebo demo already used. Adds an `autoconfigure` launch argument (default `true`); set it to `false` when a lifecycle manager such as `nav2_lifecycle_manager` drives the node.

---

## [0.3.2]: 2026-07-06

### Fixed
- **Backward time-jumps no longer crash the filter.** A non-monotonic sensor timestamp (a clock rewind, a replayed bag, or a WSL2 clock glitch) previously produced a negative `dt` that drove the UKF covariance non-positive-definite and aborted the process. `predict_to` now re-syncs the clock on a backward jump instead of integrating a negative step, and the UKF floors covariance eigenvalues rather than throwing. Validated on a real NCLT run that used to SIGABRT within ~2 minutes and now survives end to end.
- **Sustained GPS spikes no longer defeat the outlier gate.** Previously the chi2 gate rejected a spike at first, but after `gnss.coast_n` consecutive rejections coast mode inflated the position process noise until the gate widened enough to admit the spike (on an 8 s, 60 m spike the filter lunged to ~62 m error after ~5 s). Coast mode is meant for re-acquisition after a GPS gap, so firing it for a continuously present, consistently rejected GPS (a persistent multipath spike) was the bug. Rejection-triggered coast (and the recovery P-inflate) now only fire when the rejection streak began after a real GPS gap. Validated on a deterministic repro (sustained-spike peak error 62 m to 1.9 m, post-outage re-acquisition preserved) and in the Gazebo demo (FusionCore RMSE 18.15 m to 2.76 m, now clearly below robot_localization's 18.6 m). Adds `test_gnss_coast` (sustained-spike-stays-rejected, outage-still-recovers).
- **Gazebo outdoor demo now works end to end.** The GPS publisher tracked a static crop row instead of the robot (the ros_gz bridge emits empty frame_ids, so the body finder fell through to a heuristic that locked onto scenery): the robot is now identified by its model height. The demo also mixed wall-clock nodes with sim time, which blew up the velocity estimate under headless: every node now runs on sim time. Added a `base_link -> gnss_link` static TF (removes lever-arm warning spam) and the launch now triggers the initial lifecycle CONFIGURE.

### Added
- **Physical-plausibility GNSS gate (`gnss.max_speed`)**: rejects a fix farther from the filter's predicted position than the robot could have moved or drifted since the last accepted fix (`max_speed * dt + margin`). This catches an outlier cluster arriving at a GPS-blackout boundary that a coast-relaxed chi2 gate would otherwise admit. It is a per-platform kinematic spec (like wheel radius), not per-run tuning. Off by default (0.0). New rejection reason `IMPLAUSIBLE_JUMP`; adds two gate unit tests.
- **Adaptive magnetic-disturbance rejection (`magnetometer.field_strength` / `magnetometer.field_tolerance`)**: a clean magnetometer reading's corrected magnitude equals the local Earth field, so a reading whose magnitude deviates (a nearby motor, steel, or rebar) is rejected even when its direction would pass the heading chi2 gate. This is what makes magnetometer absolute-heading robust enough to bound heading drift through multi-minute GPS blackouts on real outdoor hardware. Off by default (field_strength 0.0). Adds three unit tests, including a blackout scenario where heading runs away to ~113 deg on encoder + gyro alone but the magnetometer pins it to ~0.
- **`gnss.coast_min_gap_s`** parameter (default 1.0 s): minimum preceding GPS gap before rejection-triggered coast may fire. Set to 0 to restore the previous gap-agnostic behavior.
- **`headless` and `start_delay` launch args** for `fusioncore_demo.launch.py`: run Gazebo with no GUI (CI / offscreen), and adjust when the robot starts driving.
- **WSL2 UDP-only Fast-DDS profile** (`fusioncore_gazebo/config/fastdds_udp.xml`): the shared-memory transport fails on WSL2 (`RTPS_TRANSPORT_SHM` errors), dropping `/cmd_vel` and corrupting `/clock`. Point `FASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE` at this profile for reliable comms. See the troubleshooting and simulation docs.
- **Benchmark regression tracking**: `evaluate.py` now emits `metrics.json`, and `tools/check_benchmark_regression.py` compares a run against `tools/benchmark_baseline.json` so a tuning change that silently worsens another sequence is caught instead of shipping unnoticed. Documented in `tools/benchmark_regression.md`.

### Changed
- **Documentation accuracy pass**: the benchmark and comparison pages no longer describe the magnetometer as a roadmap item (it ships) or `gnss.max_speed` as hypothetical (it ships), the long-blackout losses are explained honestly as dead-reckoning drift rather than the visible GPS transients, and the published NCLT numbers now carry a note that they predate a controlled full-suite re-run (the 2013-04-05 figure has regressed 12.1 m to ~19.4 m, still a 93% win).

---

## [0.3.1]: 2026-06-24

### Added
- **Raw magnetometer heading fusion**: FusionCore now subscribes to `sensor_msgs/MagneticField` and fuses the heading as a 1-DOF UKF update. Applies hard/soft iron correction (configurable 3-vector bias + 3x3 scale matrix) and tilt compensation using the current filter roll/pitch before fusing. Chi-squared gate (chi2(1, 0.99) = 9.21 by default) rejects magnetic spikes. Heading source hierarchy: DUAL_ANTENNA overrides MAGNETOMETER overrides GPS_TRACK. Enable with `magnetometer.enabled: true`. Requires calibration: collect data with a full 360-degree rotation and run `imu_calib` or `magneto` to get `hard_iron` and `soft_iron` values.
- **`mag_outlier_count` in FilterHealth**: cumulative magnetometer rejection count now published on `/fusion/debug/filter_health` alongside the existing GNSS, IMU, and encoder outlier counts.
- **Magnetometer diagnostics**: when `magnetometer.enabled: true`, a `fusioncore: Magnetometer` status block appears in `/diagnostics` with health state (OK/STALE/NOT_INIT) and outlier count.
- **`magnetometer.topic` subscriber row in topics reference**: documentation now lists the `/imu/mag` subscriber.
- 12 new unit tests: flat heading (east/north/west), declination offset, hard iron correction, tilt compensation, UKF convergence, chi2 gate rejection, heading source hierarchy, outlier counter.
- **IMU lever arm centripetal compensation**: when an IMU lever arm is configured, the measurement function adds the centripetal term (omega x (omega x r)) to the predicted acceleration so an off-center IMU is modeled correctly. Falls back to the zero-allocation hot path when the lever arm is zero, so platforms without one pay no cost.
- **GPS pre-heading lever arm option**: `gnss.apply_lever_arm_pre_heading` applies the antenna lever arm from the first fix, before heading is validated, for setups where the lever arm is known up front.
- **IMU frame auto-resolve**: `imu.frame_id` override resolves the IMU TF frame when a driver publishes an empty `header.frame_id`. Leave empty to use the message frame as before.
- **Lifecycle `autostart` parameter** (default `true`): the node self-transitions `configure` to `activate` about 200 ms after `on_configure()` returns, so it runs standalone without a lifecycle manager. Set `autostart: false` when `nav2_lifecycle_manager` drives the node, to avoid a double-activate.
- **Certified hardware config registry**: curated, tested YAML configs for known hardware setups.
- **GNSS Doppler bridge package and Gazebo demo infrastructure**: new `fusioncore_ublox` package plus simulation tooling for an end-to-end outdoor scenario.
- **Production-grade Gazebo demo with multi-event GPS scenario**: scripted GPS outlier and dropout events for reproducible demos.
- **Docker support**: published image at `ghcr.io/manankharwar/fusioncore` with CI auto-tagging on release, plus a Docker tutorial in the docs.
- **Field tooling**: bag-recording launch file, a field day checklist, and four troubleshooting guides.

### Changed
- **`fusioncore_ros` migrated to `ament_cmake_auto`** for ROS 2 Lyrical support: Lyrical dropped `ament_target_dependencies`, so build dependencies now come from `package.xml`. Added `std_msgs` as an explicit dependency for the `GnssStatus`/`FilterHealth` messages. Eigen3 and PROJ stay explicit.
- **tf2 headers use `.hpp` uniformly**: Lyrical renamed `tf2/LinearMath/*.h` to `.hpp`. The temporary `__has_include` guard was dropped in favor of `.hpp` everywhere. Still builds on Jazzy.

### Fixed
- **Sensor subscriptions now use `SensorDataQoS` (BEST_EFFORT)**: all sensor subscriptions previously used the default reliable QoS, which silently fails to connect to standard sensor drivers that publish best-effort. Switching to `SensorDataQoS` makes IMU, GPS, and encoder topics connect out of the box.

## [0.3.0]: 2026-06-04

### Added
- **GNSS observability topics**: every GPS fix now publishes a structured message on `/fusion/debug/gnss_status` with the exact rejection reason (`ACCEPTED`, `CHI2_FAILED`, `HDOP_HIGH`, `MIN_SATS`, `FIX_TYPE_LOW`, `DELAY_TOO_LARGE`), Mahalanobis distance squared vs the chi2 threshold, fix metadata, and current coast mode state. Replaces the generic warning log line with auditable per-fix data.
- **Filter health topic**: `/fusion/debug/filter_health` publishes at 1 Hz with innovation norms per sensor, position and heading 1-sigma uncertainty (meters and degrees), heading source, GPS coast mode state, and cumulative outlier counts. All fields are plain `float64` — plottable directly in Foxglove, PlotJuggler, or rqt without a custom panel.
- **Two new message types**: `fusioncore_ros/msg/GnssStatus` and `fusioncore_ros/msg/FilterHealth`. No external dependencies added.
- **Lever arm sigma gating**: lever arm correction now requires heading uncertainty below `gnss.lever_arm_max_heading_sigma_deg` (default 20°) in addition to `heading_validated`. During prolonged turns where heading degrades, the lever arm is silently disabled until heading tightens. `lever_arm_used` and `heading_sigma_deg` published on `/fusion/debug/gnss_status` for every fix.
- **Configurable heading motion thresholds**: `gnss.track_heading_min_speed` and `gnss.track_heading_max_yaw_rate` were previously hardcoded at 0.2 m/s and 0.3 rad/s. Now exposed as YAML parameters so platforms with different motion profiles can tune when GPS displacement counts toward heading observability.
- **Complete config YAML**: `fusioncore.yaml` rewritten to document all 87 parameters with inline explanations. Every hardware YAML updated with missing params (`q_encoder_wz_bias`, `outlier_threshold_vslam`, `adaptive.ground_constraint`, correct motion models).

### Fixed
- **Mahalanobis distance computed once per GPS fix**: previously `predict_measurement` ran twice for GNSS updates (once in `is_outlier`, once implicitly). Now computed inline with a single LDLT factorization that is also stored for observability.
- **`configuration.md` had a non-existent param**: `gnss.degraded_noise_multiplier` was documented but never implemented. Removed. Also removed a duplicate coast mode section.
- **Husky config missing motion model**: `clearpath_husky.yaml` had no `motion_model` set. Added `DifferentialDrive` — Husky is a differential drive robot and the config should reflect that.
- **CITATION.cff stale**: was at 0.2.3 while code was at 0.2.4. Synced.

### Changed
- Rejection log messages now include structured fields: `GNSS fix rejected: CHI2_FAILED (hdop=1.20, d2=847.3, threshold=16.27)` instead of the previous generic message.

---

## [0.2.4]: 2026-05-19

### Added
- **`gps_msgs/GPSFix` support**: set `gnss.use_gps_fix: true` to subscribe to `/gnss/fix` as `gps_msgs/GPSFix` instead of `sensor_msgs/NavSatFix`. Unlocks RTK_FLOAT status (status code 20, unreachable via NavSatFix), uses receiver-native `hdop`/`vdop` fields, `satellites_used` for the quality gate, and `err_horz`/`err_vert` (95% CI bounds) as a fallback covariance source. Default is `false`; existing NavSatFix setups are unaffected.

### Changed
- `package.xml` (both packages): maintainer name corrected to Manan Kharwar, maintainer email updated
- `package.xml` (both packages): added `<url>` tags for website, repository, bugtracker, and documentation so index.ros.org renders clickable links

---

## [0.2.3]: 2026-05-10

### Added
- **VSLAM pose fusion**: accepts `nav_msgs/Odometry` from ORB-SLAM3, MOLA, slam_toolbox, or any VIO/LIO source via `vslam.topic`. Enables visual-inertial fusion without GPS.
- **Dual IMU support**: second IMU input via `imu2.topic` with independent noise and outlier parameters.
- **GPS velocity fusion**: fuses Doppler-derived velocity from a GNSS receiver via `gnss.velocity_topic`.
- **Radar Doppler velocity fusion**: fuses radar radial velocity via `radar.velocity_topic`.
- **Pluggable motion models**: select differential drive, Ackermann, or omnidirectional via `motion_model` parameter.
- **Sensor wait**: filter holds initialization until all declared sensors have published at least once.
- **Deterministic replay**: `use_sim_time`-aware replay for reproducible benchmark runs.
- **Docker container and `quick_test.sh`**: one-command environment for testing without a full ROS install.
- **`imu.topic` parameter**: override the IMU subscription topic at runtime without launch file changes.
- **Adaptive R-inflation**: breaks cascading outlier rejection loops when GPS quality degrades gradually.
- **`publish.tf` toggle**: suppress TF broadcast independently of odometry publishing for multi-robot setups.
- Ackermann vehicle configuration and documentation.
- GPS velocity and wheel slip detection documentation.

### Fixed
- VSLAM frame alignment and reinitialization recovery after GPS-denied stretches.
- `encoder2` noise parameters and config accuracy.
- `nav2_params` global_frame corrected from `map` to `odom` for GPS-only navigation.
- Dockerfile apt list errors on fresh builds.
- `quick_test.sh` four-check validation on clean setup.

## [0.2.2]: 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **`init.stationary_window` hangs with zero-timestamp IMU drivers**: the bias window used message timestamps to measure elapsed time. IMU drivers that publish `stamp={sec=0, nanosec=0}` caused the window to never complete, silently blocking filter initialization and preventing `/fusion/odom` from publishing. Window timing now uses wall clock (`this->now()`), making it immune to message timestamp values.
- **`publish.force_2d` incomplete**: `force_2d: true` zeroed `position.z` in the published odometry and TF but left `twist.linear.z` (vertical velocity) non-zero. For a ground robot, publishing a non-zero VZ is misleading. Both are now zeroed consistently.

### Added
- **Troubleshooting page**: covers the most common failure modes: lifecycle not activating, Madgwick filter conflict, zero-timestamp IMU drivers, TF conflicts, outlier gate tuning, and more.
- **RTABMAP + Madgwick separation guide** in `icp-indoor.md`: documents the correct IMU topic split when running FusionCore alongside RTABMAP and `icp_odometry`.

---

## [0.2.1]: 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **`duatic_mecanum.yaml`**: `ukf.q_orientation` was `0.01`, causing yaw drift at IMU rates. Corrected to `1.0e-9`.
- **CMakeLists versions**: `fusioncore_ros` and `fusioncore_core` project versions were out of sync with `package.xml`. Both now track `0.2.1`.

### Added
- **`wheels_indoor.yaml`**: new hardware config for any indoor robot with IMU + wheel odometry, no GPS. Covers differential drive, mecanum, Turtlebot3, ROS 2 Control, Nav2 default setups.
- **`icp_indoor.yaml`**: new hardware config for indoor robots using LiDAR ICP odometry (KISS-ICP, rtabmap `icp_odometry`) instead of or alongside wheel encoders.
- **Hardware docs**: new decision table ("Which setup are you?") and per-config setup guides for indoor wheel and ICP setups.

---

## [0.1.1]: 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- **UKF stability**: resolved numerical instability in predict step; covariance matrix
  no longer diverges during long runs without sensor updates.
- **GPS fusion**: corrected position bias introduced by incorrect ECEF→ENU origin
  anchoring; fixes steady-state position offset.
- **Position bias**: removed residual bias accumulation in the motion model that
  appeared after extended straight-line travel.
- **Eigen rosdep key**: added missing `eigen` entry to `rosdep` dependencies so
  the buildfarm can resolve the dependency without manual intervention.
- **Sensor dropout handling**: improved graceful degradation when IMU or GNSS
  messages stop arriving mid-run.

### Added
- **`compass_msgs`**: moved into this repo as a first-party package; provides the
  `compass_msgs/Azimuth` message type for dual-antenna and magnetometer heading.
- **Mahalanobis outlier rejection**: GPS jumps and other sensor spikes are now
  gated before the UKF update step; position remains stable during brief GNSS outages.
- **UKF numerical stability hardening**: symmetric covariance enforcement and
  near-zero variance clamping added throughout the filter.
- **IMU gravity model**: accelerometer measurement function now correctly accounts
  for the gravity vector in the body frame (ENU z-up convention).
- **Full IMU replay retrodiction**: GNSS delay compensation now replays every
  buffered IMU message rather than using a single approximate `predict(dt)` call;
  handles up to 500 ms late measurements.
- **Docs published to docs.ros.org**: all four packages (`fusioncore_core`,
  `fusioncore_ros`, `fusioncore_gazebo`, `compass_msgs`) are now live under the
  Jazzy distribution.

### Changed
- `.vscode/` removed from version control; added to `.gitignore`.
- All package versions bumped to `0.1.1` to align with the rosdistro release.
