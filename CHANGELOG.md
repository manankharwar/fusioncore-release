## [0.2.4]: 2026-05-19

### Changed
- `package.xml` (both packages): maintainer name corrected to Manan Kharwar, maintainer email updated
- `package.xml` (both packages): added `<url>` tags for website, repository, bugtracker, and documentation so index.ros.org renders clickable links

---

## [0.2.3]: 2026-05-10

### Added
- **VSLAM pose fusion**: accepts `nav_msgs/Odometry` from ORB-SLAM3, MOLA, slam_toolbox, or any VIO/LIO source via `vslam.topic`. Enables visual-inertial fusion without GPS.
- **Dual IMU support**: second IMU input via `imu2.topic` with independent noise and outlier parameters.
- **GPS velocity fusion**: fuses Doppler-derived velocity from a GNSS receiver via `gnss.velocity_topic`.
- **Radar Doppler velocity fusion**: fuses radar radial velocity via `radar.velocity_topic`.
- **Pluggable motion models**: select differential drive, Ackermann, or omnidirectional via `motion_model` parameter.
- **Sensor wait**: filter holds initialization until all declared sensors have published at least once.
- **Deterministic replay**: `use_sim_time`-aware replay for reproducible benchmark runs.
- **Docker container and `quick_test.sh`**: one-command environment for testing without a full ROS install.
- **`imu.topic` parameter**: override the IMU subscription topic at runtime without launch file changes.
- **Adaptive R-inflation**: breaks cascading outlier rejection loops when GPS quality degrades gradually.
- **`publish.tf` toggle**: suppress TF broadcast independently of odometry publishing for multi-robot setups.
- Ackermann vehicle configuration and documentation.
- GPS velocity and wheel slip detection documentation.

### Fixed
- VSLAM frame alignment and reinitialization recovery after GPS-denied stretches.
- `encoder2` noise parameters and config accuracy.
- `nav2_params` global_frame corrected from `map` to `odom` for GPS-only navigation.
- Dockerfile apt list errors on fresh builds.
- `quick_test.sh` four-check validation on clean setup.

## [0.2.2]: 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **`init.stationary_window` hangs with zero-timestamp IMU drivers**: the bias window used message timestamps to measure elapsed time. IMU drivers that publish `stamp={sec=0, nanosec=0}` caused the window to never complete, silently blocking filter initialization and preventing `/fusion/odom` from publishing. Window timing now uses wall clock (`this->now()`), making it immune to message timestamp values.
- **`publish.force_2d` incomplete**: `force_2d: true` zeroed `position.z` in the published odometry and TF but left `twist.linear.z` (vertical velocity) non-zero. For a ground robot, publishing a non-zero VZ is misleading. Both are now zeroed consistently.

### Added
- **Troubleshooting page**: covers the most common failure modes: lifecycle not activating, Madgwick filter conflict, zero-timestamp IMU drivers, TF conflicts, outlier gate tuning, and more.
- **RTABMAP + Madgwick separation guide** in `icp-indoor.md`: documents the correct IMU topic split when running FusionCore alongside RTABMAP and `icp_odometry`.

## [0.2.1]: 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **`duatic_mecanum.yaml`**: `ukf.q_orientation` was `0.01`, causing yaw drift at IMU rates. Corrected to `1.0e-9`.
- **CMakeLists versions**: `fusioncore_ros` and `fusioncore_core` project versions were out of sync with `package.xml`. Both now track `0.2.1`.

### Added
- **`wheels_indoor.yaml`**: new hardware config for any indoor robot with IMU + wheel odometry, no GPS. Covers differential drive, mecanum, Turtlebot3, ROS 2 Control, Nav2 default setups.
- **`icp_indoor.yaml`**: new hardware config for indoor robots using LiDAR ICP odometry (KISS-ICP, rtabmap `icp_odometry`) instead of or alongside wheel encoders.
- **Hardware docs**: new decision table ("Which setup are you?") and per-config setup guides for indoor wheel and ICP setups.

## [0.1.1]: 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- **UKF stability**: resolved numerical instability in predict step; covariance matrix
  no longer diverges during long runs without sensor updates.
- **GPS fusion**: corrected position bias introduced by incorrect ECEF→ENU origin
  anchoring; fixes steady-state position offset.
- **Position bias**: removed residual bias accumulation in the motion model that
  appeared after extended straight-line travel.
- **Eigen rosdep key**: added missing `eigen` entry to `rosdep` dependencies so
  the buildfarm can resolve the dependency without manual intervention.
- **Sensor dropout handling**: improved graceful degradation when IMU or GNSS
  messages stop arriving mid-run.

### Added
- **`compass_msgs`**: moved into this repo as a first-party package; provides the
  `compass_msgs/Azimuth` message type for dual-antenna and magnetometer heading.
- **Mahalanobis outlier rejection**: GPS jumps and other sensor spikes are now
  gated before the UKF update step; position remains stable during brief GNSS outages.
- **UKF numerical stability hardening**: symmetric covariance enforcement and
  near-zero variance clamping added throughout the filter.
- **IMU gravity model**: accelerometer measurement function now correctly accounts
  for the gravity vector in the body frame (ENU z-up convention).
- **Full IMU replay retrodiction**: GNSS delay compensation now replays every
  buffered IMU message rather than using a single approximate `predict(dt)` call;
  handles up to 500 ms late measurements.
- **Docs published to docs.ros.org**: all four packages (`fusioncore_core`,
  `fusioncore_ros`, `fusioncore_gazebo`, `compass_msgs`) are now live under the
  Jazzy distribution.

### Changed
- `.vscode/` removed from version control; added to `.gitignore`.
- All package versions bumped to `0.1.1` to align with the rosdistro release.
