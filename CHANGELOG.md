## [0.4.0]: 2026-09-14

This is the 0.4.0 candidate rather than a patch release. Two public fields were
removed from `FusionCoreConfig`, so code that sets them directly against
`fusioncore_core` stops compiling, and four defaults now change behaviour for an
existing user who upgrades without touching their config. Read the Changed
section before upgrading; nothing else in the release needs action.

### Changed

- **Four defaults now do something they previously did not.** Each is covered in
  detail below; the table is here so nobody has to find them.

  | setting | was | now | effect |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `gnss.recovery_rejection_n` | 0, off | 15 | post-blackout P inflation fires |
  | `gnss.continuity_auto` | new | `true` | fix-to-fix gate arms itself after 100 fixes |
  | `zupt.accel_std_threshold` | new | 0.5 | the IMU can veto a ZUPT |
  | `gnss.gps_track_heading_cross_check_deg` | new | 15.0 | a disagreeing GPS track heading is refused |

  All four were shipped on deliberately. The two GNSS ones close failure modes
  that make a filter look healthy while being unrecoverable, which is not a
  condition to leave opt-in. If you need the previous behaviour, set each to 0.

### Removed

- **Two `FusionCoreConfig` fields nothing read.** `gnss_recovery_timeout_s` was
  declared, documented with a description of behaviour that did not exist, set in
  a shipped config, and never read by the filter. `encoder_nhc_vy_sigma` was
  written by the node into a field nothing consumed, while the parameter that
  feeds it reached `encoder.vel_noise_y` by a second assignment that did work, so
  anyone reading the struct to find out how the non-holonomic constraint is
  applied picked the wrong field.

  The ROS parameter `gnss.recovery_timeout_s` is still **declared**, so existing
  configs keep loading, and the node now warns once if it is set to anything but
  zero rather than silently doing nothing. Direct users of `fusioncore_core` who
  set either struct field will need to delete those lines. Closes #114.

### Added

- **CI now catches a ROS parameter that never reaches the filter.** A parameter can
  be declared, documented, set in a shipped config and silently do nothing: the node
  accepts it, `ros2 param get` echoes it back, and no code reads it. Two had already
  slipped through that way (#114). `tools/check_config_wiring.py` extracts every
  `config.<field> = ... get_parameter("<name>")` pair from `fusion_node.cpp` and fails
  if the field is never read by `fusioncore_core`, matching on the field rather than the
  parameter name so a deliberately renamed mapping is handled. Comments are stripped
  before counting, or a field named in its own doc comment would look used. Run against
  the tree immediately before #114 it reports exactly the two dead mappings removed there,
  which is what makes it trustworthy rather than merely green. It reports its own scope
  honestly: 76 of 141 declared parameters map into `FusionCoreConfig`, and the 65 that
  reach the node directly are not covered (#131 tracks that half). Contributed by
  Rayan-and-beyond. Closes #127.

- **Post-blackout GNSS re-acquisition.** The largest behavioural change in this
  release and the reason for the version bump. See Fixed below for the mechanism
  and the numbers; the short version is that a filter which had dead-reckoned
  through a multi-minute GNSS outage previously never recovered, and now does.

- **`gnss.continuity_auto`: the fix-to-fix gate measures its own threshold.** The
  continuity gate is the only outlier test that can see a metre-scale spike, because
  chi2 judges a fix against the filter and its scale is `S = HPH' + R`: on a
  2026-09-06 rover log a spike had to exceed 29 m before chi2 would reject it. The
  gate existed but shipped off, because the right threshold is a property of the
  receiver and asking a user to read a header and run a tool over a bag meant
  nobody would.

  So it measures instead. For the first 100 gated fixes it records the largest
  residual against a least-squares line through the last five accepted fixes, then
  holds `clamp(1.5 * max_residual, 2.0, 25.0)` for the rest of the run. Across
  1287 fixes from six rover logs the largest residual was 3.81 m, which lands the
  threshold near 5.7 m and would have rejected nothing on that clean data, while a
  hand-picked 4.0 caught injected spikes from 4 m up. Deliberately looser than the
  hand-picked value, because rejecting good fixes is the failure that has cost this
  project most and an accepted 3 m spike moves the trajectory about 0.25 m.

  Learned once and then held: a sliding estimate would be dragged upward by exactly
  the spike train it is there to catch. The cost is that a receiver calibrated under
  open sky carries that threshold into canopy where its honest scatter is larger,
  which the 1.5x margin is the headroom for, and a run that starts rejecting shows
  up in the outcome tally. `gnss.continuity_max_m` above zero still overrides it
  with a fixed number. Closes #116.

- **`gnss.gps_track_heading_cross_check_deg`: refuse a GPS track heading that
  disagrees with the heading you already have.** Course over ground is not body
  heading. On any curved path the two differ by a real bias, and a biased
  measurement pulls the estimate wrong no matter how honest its covariance is. The
  check is the median of recent disagreements rather than a single sample, so one
  bad bearing cannot veto a good source and a persistent bias cannot hide behind
  one good one. Default 15 degrees, 0 disables. Closes #118.

- **`zupt.accel_std_threshold`: ask the accelerometer before believing the wheels
  are stopped.** Wheels reporting zero is not the same thing as a stationary robot.
  An encoder that dies mid-run keeps publishing zero while the robot drives; ZUPT
  then pins velocity to zero, the filter holds position noise down, and it spends
  the rest of the run refusing to let GNSS move it. On the run that found this the
  estimate recovered about 7 m of 20 m actually driven.

  The accelerometer is the one sensor a dead encoder cannot fool, so the standard
  deviation of accelerometer magnitude over the last 100 samples is checked before
  ZUPT fires. Measured on this project's rover: **1.69 to 2.25 m/s^2 driving against
  0.013 to 0.021 m/s^2 parked**, two orders of magnitude apart, so the 0.5 default
  sits nowhere near either population. `FusionCoreStatus::zupt_blocked_by_imu` says
  when the guard is why ZUPT is not firing, which matters on a high-vibration
  platform where the honest answer is to raise it. Three tests including a negative
  control that fails without the guard. Closes #130.

- **`gnss.min_satellites` can no longer silently reject every fix.** A `NavSatFix`
  carries no satellite count. Setting `min_satellites` above zero while subscribing
  to `NavSatFix` therefore rejected 100% of fixes, forever, with no error: the node
  accepted the parameter, `ros2 param get` echoed it back, and the filter published
  a dead-reckoned pose that looked plausible. The node now refuses the combination
  at configure time and says which of the two settings to change. Extracted as
  `min_satellites_gate.hpp` so the predicate is testable without a live node.
  Closes #115.

- **Encoder rejections say why, and how surprising they were.** The encoder path
  had the same defect the GNSS path was fixed for in 0.3.9: a rejected update was
  indistinguishable from an update that never arrived.
  `FusionCoreStatus::encoder_rejection_reason` and `encoder_chi2` now name the
  cause and the Mahalanobis distance behind it. #124.

- **A predicted yaw channel for radar and GNSS velocity inputs.** Both measure
  translation and neither measures yaw rate, so fusing them with a fabricated zero
  pulled the yaw estimate toward zero on every update. They now substitute the
  filter's own predicted yaw rate for the channel they cannot observe, which is
  the same treatment the encoder's ignored channels already got. Closes #113.

- **A reference config for BNO085 + F9P + PMW3901 on a tracked base**, plus the 19
  parameters that were missing from the reference config entirely, plus a pointer
  in all four GPS configs to how to measure their own spike-gate threshold instead
  of copying one. #107.

- **A secondary twist source can declare which channels it actually measures**, and
  the encoder WZ bias is now added when predicting a yaw channel that source does
  not provide. Closes #108.

- **`imu.fixed_rate_hz`: propagate by a nominal dt instead of trusting stamp differences.** Anything downstream of an integrator amplifies timestamp error. On one recorded run, shifting every IMU stamp by a single microsecond and changing nothing else moved final yaw by 109 degrees. Most of that is an unbounded quaternion covariance rather than the stamps, but the sensitivity is real, and Martin Pecka noted on ROS Discourse that his team never computes dt in fusion from IMU timestamps at all, assuming the configured rate instead.

  Set above zero and the propagation step no longer depends on stamp jitter. Getting that to be true rather than nearly true took two attempts: letting only the first message through on its raw stamp left 76 degrees of sensitivity, and re-basing the clock to each incoming stamp left 2.4 degrees, because `(t + nominal) - t` rounds differently for every `t` and this filter is chaotic enough that any nonzero difference saturates. The clock now stays on the nominal grid and the sensitivity is gone.

  **The hazard is documented and detected**, because a wrong rate is systematic rather than noisy: the filter integrates the wrong amount of time on every step. `FusionCoreStatus::imu_fixed_rate_mismatch` flags a disagreement above 2%, measured from the raw stamps *before* the stale gate, since a wrong rate is exactly what starts getting IMU messages rejected and measuring only survivors would bias the detector. That rejection is itself pinned by a test: a 9% rate error eventually pushes the clock past `max_measurement_delay` and the IMU starts being discarded, which is a far more visible symptom than a slightly wrong dt. Default is 0, so nothing changes for anyone.

- **`filter_health` now says when the GNSS outlier gate cannot fire.** Three fields, `gnss_chi2_max`, `gnss_chi2_threshold` and `gnss_chi2_samples`: the largest Mahalanobis distance the chi2 gate has seen all run, what it is judged against, and how many fixes are behind that. A single small innovation is normal and healthy, so no per-fix field can show this. It is the *largest* across a whole run staying far below the threshold that means the gate has not been passing good fixes, it has been incapable of rejecting a bad one. On a rover log from 2026-09-06 the biggest of 222 fixes sat **39x below firing** while every fix reported `ACCEPTED`, which reads exactly like a clean run.

  The node also warns once, after at least 100 fixes, when the ratio falls under 0.1, and the message points at the two things that cause it: an uncertain filter (the gate scales with `P`, so check `heading_sigma_deg`) or a receiver reporting a covariance far larger than its actual fix-to-fix noise. It names `gnss.continuity_max_m` as the gate that judges a fix against its neighbours instead and does not scale with `P`. Closes #97.

- **`zupt.position_noise_scale`: stop a parked robot chasing its own GPS.** ZUPT fuses `[VX=0, VY=0, WZ=0]`, which pins velocity and says nothing about position. So a stationary robot's position covariance kept growing between fixes, the Kalman gain stayed near 0.75, and every incoming fix dragged the estimate. Measured on a u-blox M9N parked for 57 seconds with wheel encoders confirming stillness: the receiver's reported position moved 9.76 m and the fused position followed it for **10.16 m**, on a robot that did not move at all.

  Setting the scale below 1.0 holds the position covariance down while the wheels say the robot is still, so it decays as fixes arrive and consecutive fixes are averaged rather than followed. Measured at 0.001 across **11 parked windows from six field runs**, mean excursion falls from 3.49 m to **1.64 m**, whole-run loop closure is unchanged within noise, and no additional fixes are rejected. It gets no further on its own, and `zupt.gnss_noise_scale` below is the reason why. Not applied while GNSS coast is active, since coast inflation exists to re-admit GNSS after a blackout and cancelling it here would change an unrelated behaviour. The scale is handed back as soon as the encoders report motion.

  The default stays at 1.0, so nothing changes for anyone: this is measured on one robot with one receiver, which is not enough to move a default. `test_idle_drift.cpp` pins the behaviour, including that motion restores the scale, because a robot that parked once and stayed over-confident afterwards would be a worse bug than the one being fixed.

  Prompted by Martin Pecka on ROS Discourse, who described a parked robot's estimate not drifting toward the GNSS mean as the property that matters for GNSS integration. FusionCore failed that test; this is the measurement and the fix.


---

- **`zupt.gnss_noise_scale`: measure the receiver while the robot is parked, rather than trusting or distrusting it by a fixed amount.** Suppressing position process noise stops the covariance growing, but it does not touch the other half of the problem. A Kalman filter assumes measurement errors are white, so sixty parked fixes of a fixed point shrink its uncertainty by about sqrt(60). GNSS error is not white over a minute: multipath, ionosphere and satellite geometry drift slowly, so consecutive fixes are largely the same error repeated. The filter ends up far more confident than the geometry supports and carries that into the next leg of the run.

  Standing still is the one moment in a run where this is checkable, because every fix is then sampling the same physical point. Two things are measured from the parked fixes, per axis: the **magnitude** of their spread against the sigma the receiver declares, squared; and their **lag-1 autocorrelation** `r`, where the honest effective sample size is `N(1-r)/(1+r)` so the noise must carry a factor `(1+r)/(1-r)`. The applied inflation is the product, capped by this setting. So the number bounds how far one bad parked window can push the filter and does **not** decide the amount, and there is nothing to retune per environment or per receiver.

  Which term dominates was the surprise. On the 57 s window the magnitude term stayed at exactly 1.0 throughout: the receiver declared 21 to 45 m while actually spreading 0.4 to 3.3 m, so it was not over-confident, it was pessimistic. The entire correction came from the correlation term, measured at 0.63 rising to 0.985, an effective-sample factor of 5 rising past the 100 cap. That window went from 10.16 m of drift to **0.10 m**. Across all 11 windows: 3.49 m with neither measure, 1.64 m with process noise alone, **0.74 m** with both, helping in 8 and hurting in none.

  The correlation term fires for an honest receiver too, and it should: an RTK unit correctly reporting 2 cm still has errors correlated over minutes, so a filter that parks for a minute and averages sixty of them is wrong about how much it knows even though every covariance it was handed was accurate. That is a general defect, not a bad-receiver defect. `filter_health` publishes what was measured (`gnss_parked_sigma_observed`, `_declared`, `_correlation`, `_inflation`), and `AnHonestReceiverEarnsNoInflation` pins the property that a white, correctly-declared receiver is left alone even with the cap set to 1000. Default is 1.0, which disables it.

  **The cost is real:** a robot parked for a long time cannot re-acquire if it was genuinely lost before it stopped. For a stop of tens of seconds that does not matter; for one parked overnight it does. The evidence is dropped the moment the encoders report motion. Prompted, like `zupt.position_noise_scale`, by Martin Pecka's phase-lock explanation on ROS Discourse.

### Fixed

- **A filter that dead-reckoned through a GNSS outage now comes back.** This was
  the single worst behaviour in the library and it took five separate defects to
  clear. On NCLT 2012-06-15, aligned on the pre-blackout segment, error 300 s after
  fixes returned went from **277 m to 13 m**. On a log with gaps of 275, 129, 65
  and 55 s, error 300 s after the 129 s gap went from **746 m to 78 m**. On NCLT
  2013-04-05, ATE went from 277.6 m to **189.7 m**, a 31.7% improvement reproduced
  twice against two pre-fix runs.

  The mechanism, in the order the pieces were found:

  1. **The inflation had no size that could work.** After minutes of dead reckoning
     the filter's error is far larger than its own `P`, so every returning fix looks
     like a gross outlier to chi2 and is rejected forever. The inflation is now
     sized from the rejected innovation itself, because the innovation *is* the
     measurement of how far off the filter is and no fixed constant brackets
     arbitrary drift. `gnss.p_inflate_sigma` is now a floor rather than the value.
  2. **Only chi2 could arm it.** Recovery was decided inside the chi2 branch, so a
     cascade that began at the continuity gate never armed it, which is most of
     them. The decision moved to whichever gate rejects first. Closes #120.
  3. **A 3-DOF gate cannot be opened by moving two of its axes.** The GNSS position
     gate includes Z, so inflating only X and Y left it shut. The vertical term is
     now sized from the vertical innovation.
  4. **The gap test was in absolute seconds.** At 1 Hz the healthy spacing between
     fixes *is* `gnss_coast_min_gap_s`, so an absolute 1.0 s test called every
     single fix "after a gap" and the spike protection disappeared exactly where it
     was needed. Measured against six rover logs all running a median 1.00 s with no
     dropouts, and a 120 s sustained 300 m spike that was rejected 600 of 600 times
     at 5 Hz dragged the filter 301 m off at 1 Hz. The threshold is now relative to
     the receiver's own measured cadence.
  5. **The continuity history was allowed to span the gap.** This was the one that
     hid the rest. The history is also where the fix cadence is derived, so a buffer
     spanning an outage produced a mean spacing of 115 s instead of 0.2. Everything
     downstream inherited it: "have we just had an outage" became "was the gap longer
     than 231 seconds", so every outage shorter than that stopped being recognised as
     an outage at all and the recovery path never armed. The gate itself was healthy
     by every measure you could take from outside: sensible rejection rate, rejecting
     genuine outliers, threshold nowhere near unreachable. What was broken was a
     statistic it exported to something else. The history now starts fresh whenever
     the incoming fix is more than twice the buffer's own mean spacing away.

  One accepted fix is also no longer enough to call an outage over. A fix landing
  near a badly drifted estimate passes, corrects nothing, and used to disarm
  recovery for the rest of the run: on one log, 1 accepted against 1999 rejected
  and 690 m out. Recovery now stays armed until several fixes in a row are accepted.

- **A GNSS blackout no longer disables spike rejection for the rest of the run.**
  `post_outage_unconfirmed_` is a latch: the first rejection cascade following a real
  gap sets it, and it should clear once several fixes in a row are accepted. The code
  that cleared it sat inside `reset()`, eleven lines below the line zeroing its own
  counter, so it never ran on an accepted fix and the latch never cleared. Every later
  cascade then counted as "this follows a gap" even when the receiver had never left,
  which unlocks the recovery inflation on a continuous outlier: exactly what
  `gnss.coast_min_gap_s` exists to prevent, re-opened by an outage minutes earlier.

  Measured on a blackout, clean recovery to 0.04 m, then a sustained 300 m offset with
  the fix cadence never interrupted. Before, the filter rejected 15 and then accepted
  the remaining **586 of 601**, ending **299.97 m** out, sitting on the spike. After,
  it rejects **601 of 601** and ends 25.39 m out, which is dead reckoning for the 120 s
  window. In plain terms: driving under a bridge used to disable the defence against
  multipath off a building for the rest of that run. `BlackoutDoesNotUnlockRecoveryForALaterSpike`
  pins it and fails by 299.97 m without the fix. Closes #132.

- **No more inventing a DOP in order to gate on it, and no more blaming
  `min_satellites` for rejections it did not cause.** When a driver supplies no DOP,
  one was synthesised from the covariance and then compared against DOP thresholds,
  which is comparing metres to a unitless ratio. Synthetic DOP is now marked as such
  and skipped by the gate. Separately, any fix refused by `is_valid()` for a reason
  with no specific branch was reported as `MIN_SATS`, which sent at least one
  investigation in the wrong direction; a `QUALITY_OTHER` catch-all now says
  honestly that the fix was refused and the reason is not one of the named ones.
  Both reason values are appended, so no existing published code shifts.
  Closes #123.

- **The GPS track-heading turn guard is sampled at IMU rate**, not at fix rate,
  because a turn that starts and finishes between two fixes was invisible to it.
  The discard reason is now published rather than inferred. Closes #111, closes #112.

- **The parked-motion straightness bar is 0.85, not 0.70.** Measured against real
  parked windows, which reach 0.72, so the old value false-positived on a genuinely
  stationary robot. Straightness is displacement divided by path length: a parked
  receiver wanders and returns so its path length accumulates while its displacement
  does not, measured at 0.37 to 0.72, while a robot actually going somewhere climbs
  toward 1.0. Displacement alone cannot separate them, a parked window in these logs
  reached 12.85 m of displacement.

- **A turn inside the GPS track-heading baseline no longer collapses the yaw covariance.** Contributed by Ignacio Villanua (#109), found on a real UGV running low-rate GPS with noisy IMU and encoders.

  Two yaw-rate gates already existed and neither closed this hole. One stops distance ACCUMULATING while turning; the other stops heading FUSING when the yaw rate is high at the instant of the fix. Between them a robot can drive straight, turn, then drive straight again, and fuse on the third leg while the reference position is still from before the turn. `atan2(dy, dx)` then returns the chord across an L-shaped path rather than the heading of either leg.

  The damage comes from `sigma_hdg = sigma_xy / baseline`: a long baseline makes that wrong bearing look extremely confident, so the filter's own yaw covariance collapses onto it. Confidently wrong, which is the worst failure mode this project has.

  A turn anywhere in the window now discards it and restarts the baseline from the current fix. The detection sits before the `MIN_STEP` early return deliberately, because an in-place spin barely moves the antenna and gating it on distance would miss the case it exists to catch.

  Follow-up on merge: the new flag is also cleared in `init()` and `reset()`, alongside the heading state it belongs with, and `TurnInsideTheBaselineDiscardsTheWindow` pins it.

- **`gnss.enabled`: a master switch for GNSS.** Contributed by Ignacio Villanua (#110). Defaults to `true`, so nothing changes for anyone. Set it false and no GNSS subscription is created at all, which lets the same stack run indoors without binding to absent topics or logging about fixes that will never arrive.

  Follow-up on merge: the sensor-wait no longer expects a GNSS fix when the switch is off (otherwise an indoor robot blocked for the full timeout on the exact case the feature exists for), and the GNSS Doppler velocity input is covered by the same switch.

- **The filter now notices when its wheel odometry has died mid-run.** ZUPT fires on near-zero encoder velocity, and encoders that lose power report ZERO rather than going silent, which is indistinguishable from a parked robot. With `zupt.position_noise_scale` and `zupt.gnss_noise_scale` enabled that became far worse than it used to be: the filter holds its position covariance down AND distrusts GNSS by up to the cap, so the robot drives away while the estimate sits still, actively ignoring the GPS telling it otherwise. Enabling the idle-drift work turned a sensor dropout into a frozen pose.

  Not hypothetical: on the development rover all four encoders share one breadboard power rail, and it worked loose on 2026-09-11, taking out every wheel at once.

  **Displacement cannot tell the two apart.** A genuinely parked receiver wandered 12.85 m over 57 seconds on the 2026-09-07 log, so any distance threshold that catches a driving robot also fires on real wander. The discriminator is STRAIGHTNESS, net displacement divided by the path length through the fixes: a parked receiver wanders and returns, measured at 0.37 on that same window, while a robot actually driving goes one way and approaches 1.0.

  ```yaml
  zupt.parked_motion_m: 5.0              # metres of displacement before it can fire, 0 disables
  zupt.parked_motion_straightness: 0.85  # above this, the displacement is real motion
  ```

  The 0.85 is measured, not chosen. Checked against three genuinely parked windows in the 2026-09 rover logs, the worst straightness reached at any point past the distance threshold was 0.59, 0.00 and **0.72**. A first attempt at 0.70 fired on that third window, which would have disabled the idle-drift fix on a robot sitting still. A receiver whose error drifts one way under changing satellite geometry looks considerably straighter than intuition suggests.

  When it fires, ZUPT and the parked GNSS suppression are both disabled for the rest of the run and the node logs an error naming the encoder power rail. Disabling ZUPT as well as the suppression is the part that matters: releasing the covariance alone still left ZUPT pinning velocity to zero and fighting the GNSS, which recovered only 7.4 m of a 20 m drive in test. `zupt_parked_but_moving` and `zupt_parked_straightness` are on `filter_health` so a bag shows it.

  Two tests pin both directions: a dead-encoder robot must be caught and must keep tracking GNSS, and a genuinely wandering parked receiver must NOT trip it, since a false positive would disable the idle-drift fix on exactly the runs it exists for.

- **`encoder2.channels`: a secondary twist source can say which channels it actually measures.** A `Twist` message always carries all three of vx, vy and wz, so a source that fills only some of them publishes a zero for the rest. By the time it reaches the callback, that zero is indistinguishable from a measured zero.

  Reported as #107. The PMW3901 optical flow driver never assigns `angular.z`, so it publishes 0.0 on every message and leaves `twist.covariance` at zero. FusionCore fell back to `encoder2.yaw_noise`, whose default is 0.02, so every optical flow sample arrived as a confident "the robot is not rotating right now", roughly 1.1 deg/s of claimed uncertainty, competing with the gyro and the wheel encoder on every turn. The sensor cannot measure yaw rate at all. It reported a zero because the field is a zero, not because it looked.

  ```yaml
  encoder2.channels: ["vx", "vy"]     # default is all three, so nothing changes
  ```

  An omitted channel is not fused. The implementation substitutes what the measurement function would predict for it, which makes that channel's innovation exactly zero, so it contributes nothing whatever the gain works out to. Inflating the variance alone would leave a small residual pull toward whatever the message contained, and for an unfilled field that is 0.0. The yaw channel needs the encoder WZ bias added to the prediction, since `encoder_measurement_function` maps it to `WZ + B_EWZ`, and bare `WZ` would leave an innovation of `-B_EWZ` instead of zero.

  Unknown channel names warn rather than fail, and an empty list warns that nothing from that topic will be fused. Same reasoning applies to `encoder`, `imu2` and the radar velocity input, tracked in #108.

- **FusionCore now says something when it is left unconfigured.** It is a lifecycle node, so launching it the way every non-lifecycle ROS node is launched, a plain `Node(...)` in your own launch file or a bare `ros2 run`, leaves it UNCONFIGURED forever: no subscriptions, no publishers, no TF, and not one line of log after `FusionCore node created`. It looks exactly like a node that started cleanly. `autostart` does not save you, because it only covers configure to activate and nothing in the node triggers the configure.

  This is not hypothetical. A public robot repository was found running FusionCore from a hand-written launch file with a plain `Node` and no transitions, in a directory since renamed `OLD_NOT-IN-USE`. Silence is indistinguishable from a broken filter, and the user has no way to tell which they have.

  After 10 seconds in the unconfigured state the node now warns once and names all three fixes: the shipped launch file, a `LifecycleNode` with the transitions emitted, or `ros2 lifecycle set <node> configure` by hand. Ten seconds rather than one because a lifecycle manager legitimately takes time, and the message says to ignore it if one is about to configure the node. It is cancelled the moment `on_configure` runs, so a correctly launched node never prints it.

- **A GNSS fix carrying NaN or infinity is rejected before any other gate sees it.** There is no recovery from this one: a NaN reaching the state or the covariance propagates through the sigma points on the next predict, and every value the filter reports afterwards is NaN for the rest of the run.

  The subtle part is that a NaN does not fail the other gates, it passes them. Every comparison against a NaN is false, so `sigma_xy > max_sigma_xy` is false for a NaN sigma exactly as it is for a good one. A finiteness check placed anywhere but first would therefore never fire, which is where it now sits. Seen on a 2026-09-05 rover log: 17 of 246 fixes carried NaN latitude and longitude. All 17 also had status -1 so `min_fix_type` happened to stop them, but that was the driver being tidy rather than the filter being safe. New rejection reason `NOT_FINITE`, appended so no existing published value shifts.

- **A GNSS spike small enough to pass `gnss.continuity_max_m` no longer gets the NEXT good fix rejected.** The gate shipped in 0.3.9 predicted the next fix by extrapolating from the last two, `px = x1 + (x1 - x2) * r`. That puts an error in the newest reference point into the prediction multiplied by about two, so a spike that passed the limit threw the following good fix over it: the gate kept the bad sample and discarded the good one, which is worse than not gating at all. Measured on a 2026-09-07 rover log at a 3 m limit, a 1.5 m injected spike was accepted and the good fix after it was rejected, while the rejection count read 1, exactly what a log with one spike in it should look like.

  The prediction now comes from a least-squares line over the last five accepted fixes. The weight on the newest point is 0.8 rather than 2.0, so a spike that passes the limit can only move the next prediction by 0.8 of itself and can never reach the limit, at any threshold. That is arithmetic rather than tuning. Affects anyone who set `gnss.continuity_max_m` above zero; the default of 0.0 disables the gate entirely.

  The stiffer predictor costs a little through turns, so re-check the threshold against your own data. Measured across 1287 fixes from six rover logs: median residual 0.18 to 0.59 m, p99 0.95 to 3.00 m, largest 3.81 m. At 4.0 there were no rejections on clean data and every injected spike from 4 m up was caught, always the spike itself rather than its neighbour. At 3.0 it discarded 4 good fixes.

- **One undecodable topic no longer costs you the whole bag.** CDR is not self-describing, so adding a field to a message makes every older recording of it fail to deserialise. `FilterHealth` has gained fields three times, most recently in 96d0207, which meant `tools/nis_from_bag.py` reported field bags recorded days earlier as `could not be read` and the NIS numbers went with them, even though those live on `GnssStatus` and were perfectly intact. Losing an old field is annoying; losing the analysis of a field run you cannot repeat is not.

  The reader now deserialises per message, drops a topic that consistently fails, and says which one and why. `analyze()` reports it as `unreadable_topics`, so the `--json` output carries it too. A run recorded before this change reads cleanly again, with a note naming the skipped topic, and still produces every number that does not depend on it.

## [0.3.9]: 2026-09-08

### Added
- **Per-outcome counts and timestamps on `/fusion/debug/filter_health`.** The health message already named the reason the last fix was rejected, which answers "what dropped that one" but not the two questions you actually have in front of a recorded run: how often, and when. Establishing that the chi2 gate had never fired at all on the 2026-09-06 rover run took a day of replaying the bag, because nothing published said so and an inert gate looks exactly like a gate that is passing everything.

  Four parallel arrays now carry every outcome that has occurred since init: `outcome_names`, `outcome_counts`, `outcome_first_seen`, `outcome_last_seen`. A name appears only once it has happened, so an absent name is a gate that has never fired, and the timestamps are measurement stamps in the filter's own clock, so a reason can be located in a bag without replaying it. `ACCEPTED` is counted alongside the rejections, which is what makes an empty result readable: with no `gnss:ACCEPTED` either, no fix ever reached the filter, and the gates are not the problem. Reading a rejection count against the accepted count also gives a rate, and a rate is what distinguishes a gate catching spikes from a gate fighting the receiver: this is the number open issue #93 needs about the magnetometer.

  The core exposes it as `FusionCore::gnss_outcome_tally()` and `mag_outcome_tally()`. No filter behaviour changes and no existing field changes meaning: `gnss_last_reject_reason` stays sticky, naming the last rejection and surviving later accepted fixes, and `AcceptedFixDoesNotClearTheLastRejectReason` pins that. `EveryFixIsCountedExactlyOnce` pins the accounting invariant that every fix lands in exactly one bucket, and it earned its place immediately by catching a double count in the first version, where a rejection was recorded once inside `apply_gnss_update` and again by its caller.

### Added
- **`gnss.min_sigma_xy` / `gnss.min_sigma_z`, a configurable floor on the sigma a receiver reports.** There was already a floor, hardcoded at 2 cm, added so an RTK-fixed receiver reporting 3 mm could not fail its own chi2 gate. That figure assumes a receiver is honest when it claims to be that good. A u-blox M9N was measured on 2026-09-07 declaring `sigma_xy` of 0.076 m while sitting completely still, scattering 1.03 m (1-sigma radial) over 70 fixes and drifting 1.97 m end to end: over-confident by 13.6x. It only began doing this after acquiring SBAS; earlier the same day it declared a reasonable 3.16 m.

  This matters more than a covariance being wrong, because `R` is built from that number and the chi2 gate judges every fix against the same `R`. Believing 0.076 m both drags position toward each fix and risks the gate rejecting good fixes for disagreeing with an over-tight prediction, which is the same defect class as the absolute-metre gates fixed in 0.3.6. The floor is expressed in metres rather than as a multiplier deliberately: a multiplier tuned for the over-confident mode would be badly wrong when the same receiver reverts to reporting honestly, while a floor corrects one and leaves the other untouched. Defaults are unchanged at 0.02 and 0.05, so no existing setup shifts.

### Fixed
- **The docs pointed people at a Nav2 setup that cannot work.** `getting-started.md` offered "for example a `nav2_lifecycle_manager` owns it" as a reason to drive the lifecycle manually. That manager requires every node it owns to hold a `bond` heartbeat open, FusionCore does not implement that protocol, and the result is a bond timeout on every boot regardless of `bond_timeout`. FusionCore being a lifecycle node makes putting it under the manager look like the correct thing to do, which is what makes the advice actively harmful. The word `bond` appeared nowhere in the repository.

  Both `getting-started.md` and `nav2.md` now say not to do it and name the two approaches that work: leave autostart on and let the node bring itself up, or drive the transitions from your own launch file the way `fusioncore_nav2.launch.py` does. Reported from the Sowbot agricultural stack, who diagnosed it themselves and left the explanation in a launch-file comment rather than an issue.

- **The lever-arm TF warning repeated until it became wallpaper.** A missing `base_link -> antenna` transform was reported every 5 seconds for the life of the run, roughly 700 times in an hour. A missing TF does not fix itself, so this is a configuration message, not a transient one: it now reports at most three times, ten seconds apart, and the last one says so. The same applied to the IMU lever arm and is fixed alongside it. Found while testing the warning below, where nine copies scrolled past in forty-five seconds.

- **An unmeasured GNSS antenna offset was the one configuration FusionCore said nothing about.** The startup log prints the lever arm only when it is non-zero, so a `0,0,0` offset produced no output at all, and zeros are silently wrong: they tell the filter the antenna sits exactly at `base_link`, so no correction is applied. The resulting position error is the true offset rotated by heading. On flat ground the vertical part drops out and the horizontal part sweeps around as the robot turns, which reads as a cross-track bias that flips sign at the end of a row. Easy to mistake for a controller tuning problem.

  It is now warned about at the moment it starts mattering, which is when heading validates well enough for the correction to go live (or immediately, if `gnss.apply_lever_arm_pre_heading` is set). Not at configure time, because until heading validates the offset genuinely does not matter and an early warning would be noise. The message names the parameters, says to measure to the antenna's phase centre rather than its housing, notes that x and y are what move cross-track error while z only matters under tilt, and says the warning is expected if `base_link` really is at the antenna.

  Found in the Sowbot agricultural stack, whose `fusioncore.yaml` carried `# measured TODO` placeholders beside a dual-antenna heading source. Their heading validates at about 1 degree, so the correction had been live with zeros and nothing in the log mentioned it.

- **Fixes the receiver marked `NO_FIX` were dropped without a trace.** The GNSS callbacks returned early on `status < 0`, before the filter or any counter saw the message. On `filter_health` a receiver that had lost fix was therefore indistinguishable from one working normally: `gnss_outlier_count` stayed 0, no rejection reason was ever set, and the fixes were simply gone. They are now counted as `gnss:NO_FIX_REPORTED` (and `gnss2:` for a second receiver) in the outcome arrays. Found by publishing `NO_FIX` at a running node and watching nothing at all change.

- **`filter_health` published an empty `gnss_last_reject_reason` for three of the twelve rejection reasons.** The node had a second, local copy of the reason-to-string table for that field, and it had not been updated when `IMPLAUSIBLE_JUMP`, `SIGMA_XY_HIGH`, `SIGMA_Z_HIGH` and `CONTINUITY_BREAK` were added, so a fix rejected by the jump gate, either sigma gate or the continuity gate published an empty string. Empty is worse than a wrong name there, because it reads as "nothing has been rejected". The duplicate is gone and both fields now come from the one table.

- **`heading_observable_distance` was hardcoded at 5 m and unreachable from any config.** It is what flips `heading_validated`, and there was no `declare_parameter` for it, so no YAML could change it. `gnss.track_heading_min_dist` looks like the knob for this but gates something different: whether a track heading gets *fused*. A rover configured with `track_heading_min_dist: 15.0` still validated its heading at **5.04 m**, carrying **48.6 degrees** of heading uncertainty at that moment. Track heading is the bearing between two fixes, so its error is roughly GPS sigma over distance travelled, and at 6 m sigma over a 5 m baseline that is radians rather than degrees. Now exposed as `gnss.heading_observable_distance`, default unchanged at 5.0 so no existing setup shifts.

  Writing the test for it turned up the reason this was confusing. There are **two independent routes** to `heading_validated` from GPS track: the distance gate at `fusioncore.cpp:490`, and `fusioncore.cpp:1168`, which validates as a side effect whenever a track heading is actually fused, gated by `gps_track_heading_min_dist` instead. Whichever fires first wins, so raising one alone does nothing if the other is still small. The first version of the new test measured the wrong gate and reported the config as ignored when it was simply being beaten to it. `test_heading_observable_distance.cpp` now pins both paths and documents the interaction.


---

## [0.3.8]: 2026-09-01

### Added
- **Measured what an absolute heading source actually buys, before the hardware has one.** The field bags say the covariance is badly underconfident and the standing diagnosis was unobservable yaw, so `test_consistency.cpp` now measures whether a magnetometer repairs it. Without one the filter grows steadily more overconfident as GNSS degrades: mean position NEES climbs from 2.0 at clean 1 m fixes to 6.3 at 10 m fixes, where 3.0 is honest and above it means claiming an accuracy it does not have. With a magnetometer supplying absolute yaw it holds between 1.7 and 2.0 across that whole range, and the heading 2-sigma drops from 9 to 31 degrees down to under one degree. `MagnetometerHoldsCovarianceAsGnssDegrades` asserts both halves.

  It also bounds the claim honestly. In a clean scenario where heading is already good, adding the magnetometer moves heading 2-sigma from 8.4 to 0.9 degrees and leaves NIS and NEES untouched, so it is not a general covariance fix. It repairs the part of the error that comes from unobservable yaw and nothing else.

- **`tools/nis_from_bag.py`, filter consistency from any recorded run.** The same question the new consistency tests ask in simulation, asked of real hardware: does the covariance the filter reports match the errors it actually makes? It needs no ground truth, because it reads the Normalized Innovation Squared that FusionCore already records for every GNSS fix on `/fusion/debug/gnss_status`. An honest filter averages 3.0 there, the dimension of a GNSS position measurement.

  Measured across three field runs on the development rover, the median NIS was 0.02 to 0.03, so the reported covariance is roughly two orders of magnitude larger than the errors warrant, with filter heading 1-sigma between 57 and 143 degrees. The 2026-07-30 run is the control: every fix accepted, no quality gate firing, same result, so this is not a side effect of measurements being discarded. The cause is that yaw is unobservable with a 6-axis IMU, wheel encoders and GNSS position alone, and that uncertainty propagates into the position covariance.

  Chasing that number in simulation turned up the larger cause, and it is not the filter. A receiver that smooths internally reports its ABSOLUTE accuracy while emitting fixes that agree with each other far more closely. On the 2026-08-03 run the receiver declared 4.84 m horizontal 1-sigma, but the median second difference between consecutive fixes was 0.087 m, and the largest anywhere in 500 s was 1.09 m, where white noise of the declared size would give about 14 m. Consecutive fixes are roughly 160x smoother than the declared covariance implies. Both facts are true together: the absolute error really is metres, dominated by multipath, while the fix-to-fix consistency is centimetres. A Kalman filter assumes white measurement noise, so handing it the declared figure as `R` makes `S` dwarf any innovation it will ever see and NIS collapses no matter how well the filter is working. The tool measures this and says so, and warns against the obvious wrong response: shrinking `R` would make the filter track the receiver's multipath bias rigidly and report centimetre confidence in a position that is metres off. Simulation confirms the split, since with genuinely white noise at rover-like magnitudes NIS sits at 3.0 rather than 0.03.

  Two consequences are documented in `docs/known-limitations.md`. The gain is higher than optimal, so the filter tracks GNSS noise more closely than it needs to. And the chi2 gate is calibrated for a consistent filter: at the default 16.27 it is far less sensitive than its nominal 99.9% design point when NIS runs near 0.03, and the tool says so explicitly when the largest NIS in a whole run never reaches the threshold. New guide at `docs/guides/filter-consistency.md`.

- **Filter consistency tests, which ask whether the reported covariance is honest.** Every other test here checks that the estimate is close to truth. None checked whether the filter's own confidence matches the error it actually makes, and that gap is how `ukf.alpha = 0.1` survived from May to August: the filter reported a tight covariance and a valid heading while driving position backwards. `test_consistency.cpp` measures NIS (innovation against its predicted covariance, no ground truth needed, so it also works on real data) and NEES (estimation error against the reported state covariance). Both are chi-squared distributed and should average the dimension being tested, 3 for GNSS position.

  Measured on 0.3.7 with every sensor corrupted by exactly the noise the filter was told to expect: with GPS up, NIS 2.342 and NEES 1.958 against an expected 3.0, so the reported covariance is around 1.5x larger than the errors warrant. That is the conservative direction rather than the dangerous one, though it does inflate the Kalman gain, which makes the filter track GPS noise more closely than it needs to.

  The sigma-weight bug turns out to be invisible under good observability: NIS and NEES agree to three decimals across alpha 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 with GPS up, because the quaternion sigma points never spread far enough for the negative centre weight to dominate. It only shows during dead reckoning. Over a 60 s GPS blackout, median NEES across 16 seeds is 1.36 at alpha 1.0 and 6.51 at alpha 0.1, the latter overconfident by roughly 2x. `BlackoutCovarianceAndSigmaWeights` fails if those converge, so the 0.3.7 fix cannot be quietly undone. Medians, not means: per-seed blackout NEES ranges from 0.5 to 24.3, so a mean over a handful of seeds mostly reports which tail it drew, the same reason `tools/compare_runs.py` judges NCLT runs on median and p90.

### Changed
- **`autoconfigure:=false` now also stops the node activating itself.** Previously the launch files cleared the node's `autostart` only when they were driving the lifecycle themselves, so the one setting that exists to hand the transitions to a `nav2_lifecycle_manager` or to you left the node self-activating: `configure` jumped straight past `inactive` to `active` and the caller's `activate` was then rejected. That path could not have worked for anyone, but it is still a behaviour change. If you drive FusionCore's lifecycle externally, you now get `unconfigured -> inactive -> active` in the order you ask for it.

- **Rebuild an existing workspace to get the optimisation fix.** The Release default below only applies when CMake configures a build directory, so a workspace that already has `build/` keeps its unoptimised binary and sees none of the speedup. `rm -rf build install && colcon build` once, or pass `--cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`.

### Fixed
- **A plain `colcon build` produced an unoptimised filter.** No package set `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` and no install instruction passed one, so the documented build produced no optimisation flags at all. Eigen without inlining is drastically slower: the consistency suite runs in 298 s that way and 4.3 s at `-O3`, a factor of 69, and the whole core and ROS test suite went from 5 min 19 s to 42 s. For a 23-state UKF at 100 Hz on a Raspberry Pi that is the difference between keeping up and starving, and a starved filter drops delayed measurements as `DELAY_TOO_LARGE` and dead-reckons instead. `fusioncore_core`, `fusioncore_ros` and `fusioncore_ublox` now default to Release when the caller has not chosen; an explicit `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` still wins, so debug builds are unaffected.

- **`tools/quick_test.sh` could not bring the node up, and the documented manual lifecycle path could not either.** Reported by Paul Bouchier in #75. Two auto-activation paths had grown up independently of the script: the node gained an `autostart` parameter defaulting to true in 0.3.1, and the launch files gained an `autoconfigure` argument defaulting to true in 0.3.3, while `quick_test.sh` still drove `configure` and `activate` by hand as it had to before either existed. Whichever transition arrived second was invalid for the state the node had already reached, so the script failed on `configure` or on `activate` depending on which side won the race, which is why it failed differently on different machines. The script now waits for the node to reach `active` and reports the state it actually stalled in, rather than driving the transitions itself and reporting "node not found" for what was never a discovery problem. Its per call timeouts were also too short to be a real check: a single `ros2 lifecycle get` takes 5 to 10 s on a slow machine, against the 1 s the retry loop allowed.

  The same conflict broke the manual path in `fusioncore.launch.py` and `fusioncore_duatic.launch.py`. They cleared the node's `autostart` only when `autoconfigure` was on, so `autoconfigure:=false`, which exists precisely to hand the transitions to a `nav2_lifecycle_manager` or to you, left the node activating itself: `configure` jumped straight past `inactive` to `active` and the caller's `activate` was then rejected. Both now clear `autostart` unconditionally, since the launch file settles the transitions either way. `fusioncore_gazebo.launch.py` emitted both transitions without clearing `autostart` at all and had the same race.

### Verified
- Middleware compatibility on Jazzy: Fast DDS (the ROS 2 default), `rmw_zenoh_cpp` 0.2.9 and `rmw_cyclonedds_cpp`, with all `tools/quick_test.sh` checks passing under each, lifecycle transitions and the service call included. No code change was needed: every sensor subscription already uses `SensorDataQoS`.

---

## [0.3.7]: 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- **The UKF centre sigma weight was -99, and the filter drove backwards.** At 23 states with the previous `ukf.alpha` default of 0.1 and `kappa = 0`, `lambda = alpha^2*n - n = -22.77`, giving a centre weight of **-99.0** against 46 outer weights of +2.17. They sum to 1, so it is formally correct, but only for a tight sigma-point cluster. Yaw is structurally unobservable without an absolute heading source, so the quaternion sigma points spread wide, their forward displacements cancel one another, and what survives is the centre point (the one pointing correctly forward) multiplied by -99. The filter then moved position BACKWARDS while reporting a perfect velocity and a perfect heading, which is why this presented for months as "velocity right, position wrong" and resisted every covariance and process-noise explanation. Measured with a perfect encoder at 1.0 m/s over 60 s against a truth of 60.00 m: `alpha 0.1` gave **-114.06 m**, `alpha 0.5` gave 8.83 m, `alpha 1.0` gives 48.43 m. It is entirely the predict step: predict moved position -114.89 m where it should have moved +58.77, while every measurement update combined contributed 12 mm. Validated on real data, NCLT 2013-04-05 at 1x playback: **5268.80 m ATE to 131.85 m, a 97.5% reduction**, with robot_localization unchanged at ~230 m across all runs as the control. `alpha = 1.0` gives `lambda = 0` and all 47 weights non-negative, which is the standard unscaled UKF; with `kappa = 0` any alpha below 1 makes the centre weight negative, so lowering alpha to "tighten" the spread does the opposite of what it does in a low-dimensional filter. No shipped config overrode `ukf.alpha`, so every user was running -99. Reproductions in `tools/repro/`.

  Two caveats stated plainly. This does **not** fully restore the 22.96 m that commit `c8b8b1f` (19 May) measures on the same machine, so a second regression remains unidentified: alpha was the dominant cause, not the only one. And only 2013-04-05 has been re-measured; every other entry in `tools/benchmark_baseline.json` predates this fix.

- **`MagnetometerTest.BoundsHeadingDriftFromSlipDuringBlackout` asserted the bug.** Its "heading runs away without a magnetometer" threshold of 0.5 rad was calibrated against a filter with `Wm[0] = -99`. The same gyro bias and encoder slip now produce 0.41 rad, so the threshold moved to 0.3. The two assertions that actually prove the magnetometer's value, the absolute bound and the >80% reduction, are unchanged and still pass.

### Changed
- **The certified configs now say which GNSS quality gate actually runs.** `bosch-bno085-ublox-f9p-outdoor`, `microstrain-3dm-gx3-45-segway` and `xsens-mti-680g-fsae` all listed `gnss.max_hdop` as though it were the gate. Since 0.3.6 a fix carrying a `position_covariance` is gated on the receiver's reported sigma in metres and the DOP thresholds are never consulted, which for these three receivers is always. Each config now states that, and points at the sigma gate with a note to leave it at its permissive defaults unless the receiver's actual reported sigma has been logged: a gate tuned to clean-sky numbers throws away the degraded fixes you most need.
- `tools/run_nclt.sh` runs one NCLT sequence end to end with the process hygiene the harness needs (no orphaned players competing for CPU, no recorder appending to the next run's bag, a refusal to run off a 9p mount) and prints the achieved filter rate next to the ATE, because a starved run's ATE is meaningless. `tools/repro/blackout.cpp` now sweeps `ukf.alpha` instead of `gnss_coast_q_bias_factor`, which measured as a dead knob: identical results at 100 and at 1 under both the old and the new default.

---

## [0.3.6]: 2026-08-12

### Fixed
- **GNSS quality gate compared metres against thresholds named as DOP, silently rejecting good fixes (issue #73).** `sensor_msgs/NavSatFix` carries no DOP fields, so the node derives fix quality from `position_covariance` as `sqrt(variance)`, which is **metres**. That value was then compared against `gnss.max_hdop` (default 4.0) and `gnss.max_vdop` (default 6.0), parameters everyone reads as the dimensionless geometry factor where 4.0 is a permissive limit. What the defaults actually meant was "reject any fix worse than 4 m horizontal or 6 m vertical", which a standalone receiver fails constantly. Measured on 500 real fixes from a u-blox NEO-M9N outdoor run: horizontal sigma 3.6 to 6.0 m, vertical 14.4 to 24.0 m, so **all 500 fixes were rejected at the shipped defaults** and the filter dead-reckoned the entire run. Nothing surfaced this beyond a throttled log line naming a parameter that was the wrong units to begin with. `GnssFix` now carries explicit `sigma_xy` / `sigma_z` in metres, set whenever the fix has a covariance, and the gate reads those against the new `gnss.max_sigma_xy` (25.0) and `gnss.max_sigma_z` (50.0). `max_hdop` / `max_vdop` keep their original meaning and apply only when the fix has no covariance, which in practice means `gps_msgs/GPSFix` reporting receiver-native DOP. Accepted fixes are fused exactly as before: replaying the same 500-fix bag gives a bit-identical trajectory (loop closure 2.62 m, path 219.61 m). The bundled `env_urban`, `env_canopy` and `env_open` configs now express their intent in metres.
- **`/fusion/debug/gnss_status` reported `NOT_PROCESSED` for two real rejection causes.** The enum-to-string mapper feeding that topic had no case for `IMPLAUSIBLE_JUMP`, so it fell through `default` and published `NOT_PROCESSED`, the value meaning "update_gnss was never called". Anyone watching the topic saw fixes disappear with no stated cause, including our own field monitoring during a 500-fix run where 157 fixes were rejected by the jump gate. The mapper is now exhaustive and covers the two new sigma reasons as well.

- **The `gnss.max_speed` jump gate rejected ordinary GPS noise as an impossible jump.** The bound was `max_speed * gap + max_speed_margin`, entirely absolute metres. At 1 Hz with `max_speed: 2.0` and the default 5 m margin that is a 7 m bound, and a standalone receiver whose own reported sigma is ~6 m trips it constantly. Measured on a real run: **157 of 500 good fixes rejected, loop closure 2.62 m to 7.27 m**, on a rover whose actual top speed is 0.6 m/s, so no honest motion was ever involved. The bound now adds `gnss.max_speed_sigma_k` (default 5.0) multiples of the receiver's reported horizontal sigma. Replaying the same bag with the gate enabled at 2.0: **0 of 500 rejected, closure 2.62 m, identical to having the gate disabled**, so the gate no longer costs anything on good data. The noise term scales with the RECEIVER's sigma and deliberately not with the filter's covariance: chi2 is already the covariance-scaled test, and this gate exists to catch what a coast-inflated chi2 admits, so scaling it by `P` would reopen the hole it was built to plug. A test pins that property by checking the verdict on the same outlier is unchanged after a 1 s gap and a 10 s coast.

- **GPS track heading fought better heading sources and ignored its own motion gates (issue #73).** Track heading derives yaw from the GPS displacement bearing, which is course over ground. On a curved path that differs from body heading by a real bias, not just noise, so fusing it pulls the estimate wrong no matter how honest its covariance is. Two things were wrong. It ran even when a stronger absolute heading source was already active (dual antenna, magnetometer, or a 9-axis IMU orientation), all of which the `heading_source_` ladder already ranks above it. And `gps_track_heading_min_speed` / `gps_track_heading_max_yaw_rate`, documented since they were introduced as guarding this fusion, only ever gated `distance_traveled_` and the `heading_validated_` flag inside `update_distance_traveled()`: the fusion itself ran unguarded, so a slow, turning robot fused its turn radius as a heading. Reported by a user whose Nav2 path was straight without GPS and a zig-zag with it, on a robot with a stable magnetometer: with 2 m of GPS noise over the 5 m default baseline the fused heading carried 0.4 rad (23 degrees) of uncertainty, right at the `max_sigma` limit, and was competing with a magnetometer an order of magnitude better. Both guards are now applied to the fusion, and `GnssFixDebug` carries `track_heading_skipped_stronger_source` / `track_heading_skipped_motion` so a skip is visible rather than silent. Robots with no absolute heading source are unaffected: track heading remains their heading, pinned by a regression test.

### Added
- **`gnss.max_speed_sigma_k`** (default 5.0), the receiver-noise term in the jump-gate bound. See above.
- **`gnss.max_sigma_xy` and `gnss.max_sigma_z`**, the quality gate in metres of reported one-sigma. See above.
- **`SIGMA_XY_HIGH` and `SIGMA_Z_HIGH` rejection reasons**, so the reported cause names the gate that actually fired and the parameter to change. The GNSS rejection warning now prints the value, its units, and the limit it failed against.
- Eight tests pinning the two gates: the exact case from issue #73 (a 2 m / 8 m fix must be accepted), a regression guard that the DOP path still applies when no covariance is present, ordinary 6 m-sigma noise surviving the jump gate, a 700 m spike still rejected on that same noisy receiver, and the jump bound staying independent of filter covariance. The four pre-existing coast tests are unchanged, so sustained-spike rejection and post-outage recovery are unaffected. Test count is now 126.

---

## [0.3.5]: 2026-07-30

Everything here comes from one user field report (issue #73), which is the deepest integration anyone has run against FusionCore: Nav2 GPS waypoint following on real hardware.

### Added
- **A launch test that asserts `/fromLL` is advertised with the type Nav2 binds**, plus unit tests for the stale-rejection policy. The `/fromLL` defect below shipped from v0.2.1 through 0.3.4 with nothing complaining, because the only thing exercising it was a manual `ros2 service call`, which passes the type by hand and therefore always works. The new test starts the real node and checks the advertised type string, then calls the service with a robot_localization-typed client and checks the conversion on both axes. It was mutation-checked: pointed at the old type it fails, so the assertion is live rather than vacuously passing. `test_stale_rate` adds 8 unit tests pinning the two ends apart, from 2 rejections across an hour (quiet) to a 50 Hz sensor rejected wholesale (warns). Test count is now 114.

### Fixed
- **Nav2 GPS waypoint following now works (issue #73).** `followGpsWaypoints` hung forever on `[waypoint_follower]: /fromLL service client: waiting for service to appear...` even though FusionCore was advertising `/fromLL` and a manual `ros2 service call` against it worked. The name matched and the fields matched, but the type did not: FusionCore served `fusioncore_ros/srv/FromLL` while `nav2_waypoint_follower` has `robot_localization::srv::FromLL` compiled into its header (`waypoint_follower.hpp`). ROS 2 matches services on name **and** type, so from Nav2's side the service simply never existed, and because a service client waits rather than failing, nothing anywhere reported a problem. Identical field layout under a different type name is not drop-in compatibility. `/fromLL` is now advertised as `robot_localization/srv/FromLL`, so Nav2's GPS waypoint client binds with no bridge node and no robot_localization node running. This adds `robot_localization` as a dependency of `fusioncore_ros` for that one interface definition: no robot_localization code is linked or executed, `fusioncore_core` is untouched and still depends on nothing but Eigen, and Nav2 already pulls the package in for the same reason, so anyone running GPS waypoints has it regardless. `fusioncore_ros/srv/FromLL` is kept but deprecated and no longer served, so anything built against 0.3.4 or earlier still compiles. Verified live: the service advertises the expected type and converts correctly in both axes (0.0009 deg north returns 99.99 m, 0.0009 deg east returns 73.08 m at latitude 43.26).
- **Fixed a defect in the bundled Nav2 configuration that stopped the robot moving.** `fusioncore_nav2.launch.py` includes nav2_bringup's `navigation_launch.py`, which starts `collision_monitor` unconditionally (Jazzy has no launch argument to disable it) and lifecycle-manages it, while the bundled `nav2_params.yaml` had no `collision_monitor` section. That node refuses to configure without one (`parameter 'observation_sources' is not initialized`), and it sits in the command path, subscribing to `cmd_vel_smoothed` and republishing `cmd_vel`. So planning and control ran correctly, produced velocities, and nothing reached the base. `nav2_params.yaml` now ships a `collision_monitor` section. Since `observation_sources` and `polygons` are both mandatory and an empty list is rejected by the parameter parser, there is no way to declare "no sources"; instead one polygon and one source are declared and disabled, which lets the node activate and pass velocity through untouched. Verified against the shipped file: the node reaches `active` and 0.42 m/s on `cmd_vel_smoothed` comes out of `cmd_vel` unchanged, angular component intact. **This deliberately provides no obstacle protection**, matching the rest of that config which assumes GPS navigation with no map and no lidar; `docs/nav2.md` says so plainly and explains how to enable it properly with a laser. Found by the reporter of issue #73, who had to disable the collision monitor to get Nav2 up at all.
- **The stale-sensor warning reports a rate instead of crying wolf over a count.** It fired on any increase at all, so two dropped samples across an entire run produced the same alarming wall of text as a completely broken clock. That is exactly what happened to the reporter of issue #73, after he had already fixed his real skew. The warning now fires only above 1 rejection per second sustained, states the measured rate, and prints the inter-sensor offset next to the `max_measurement_delay` it is being compared against, so the number that matters and the knob that changes it appear together. Isolated drops go to debug instead. The text now also names both causes, because a lagging stamp is not always a clock problem: real transport latency on a wireless link is indistinguishable from skew at the filter, and the fix for that one is to raise `max_measurement_delay` above the measured offset rather than to touch the drivers.

## [0.3.4]: 2026-07-27

Three fixes found by running FusionCore on real hardware: one from a user's field report (issue #73) and two from a self-built GPS test rover. All three share a theme: a sensor stops being fused and nothing says so. Each is now both fixed and visible on `/fusion/debug/filter_health`.

### Fixed
- **Sensors on different clocks no longer make the filter diverge (issue #73).** A field report showed perfect wheel odometry going in and a ~10 m/s position runaway coming out. Root cause: the user's IMU driver stamped messages ~3 s ahead of the encoder's (correct) clock. The filter clock rode the IMU; every encoder message then arrived looking 3 s old; the backward-time-jump guard re-based the clock backward to fuse it; and the next IMU message re-integrated the entire 3 s window forward through the motion model again, at the IMU rate. Re-integrating a 3 s window 50 times per second turns any small velocity estimate into tens of meters per second of divergence. The fix distinguishes the two cases by the sensor's own stream: stamps that still advance while lagging the filter clock mean the sensor is on a slower clock (inter-sensor skew), so the measurement is rejected as stale and counted, keeping the clock monotonic; stamps that jump backward within their own stream mean a genuine time-base reset (bag replay restart, clock correction), which still re-bases exactly as before. Adds `imu_stale_reject_count` and `encoder_stale_reject_count` to `/fusion/debug/filter_health`, a startup warning when a sensor's `header.stamp` is more than 1 s from the node clock, and a throttled runtime warning naming the measured inter-sensor offset when stale rejections climb, so a clock mismatch is called out in plain words instead of failing silently. Adds `test_clock_skew` (3 tests: the reported scenario stays bounded, a true clock reset still re-bases, sub-window latency still fuses).

### Added
- **`max_measurement_delay` parameter.** The retrodiction window and inter-sensor staleness threshold (default 0.5 s, previously hardcoded). Raise it only for a sensor with a genuinely large known latency; if stale rejections climb, fix the sensor clocks instead.
- **`gnss_last_reject_reason` in `/fusion/debug/filter_health`.** When GPS stops fusing, the only question that matters is *why*. The per-fix reason already existed on the `/fusion/debug/gnss_status` firehose, but not on `filter_health`, which is the lightweight one-line dashboard people actually monitor at a glance and record on a field day. That topic reported a single `gnss_outlier_count`, and that counter only increments on chi2 and physical-plausibility rejects: quality-gate rejects (`HDOP_HIGH`, `VDOP_HIGH`, `FIX_TYPE_LOW`, `MIN_SATS`) and `DELAY_TOO_LARGE` never touched it, so a filter silently dropping every fix on vertical DOP looked identical on `filter_health` to one fusing cleanly, and a bag that recorded only `filter_health` (the common case) had no record of why GPS went quiet. The health message now carries the reason string of the most recent rejected fix, so a live `ros2 topic echo` or an offline bag tells you immediately whether to raise `gnss.max_vdop`, check the clock, or accept that a spike was correctly gated. The core exposes it as `FusionCoreStatus::gnss_last_rejection_reason` (a `GnssRejectionReason` enum); no filter behaviour changes. Found while bringing FusionCore up on a real M9N rover, where hours went into a rejection that this one field would have named at a glance. Adds `GNSSTest.RejectionReasonSurfacesInStatus`.
- **`gnss.max_vdop` parameter.** The vertical DOP gate was hardcoded at 6.0 while `gnss.max_hdop` was configurable, an asymmetry with a real cost: a fix can be horizontally excellent yet vertically poor (satellite geometry, sky obstructed by buildings or trees), and a ground robot running `publish.force_2d` does not care about altitude at all. There was no way to stop a good horizontal fix being rejected purely on vertical precision, and the rejection is silent to the filter (`VDOP_HIGH`), so GPS quietly stops fusing in exactly the obstructed-sky conditions where you most need it. `gnss.max_vdop` now mirrors `gnss.max_hdop`, defaulting to the previous 6.0 (no behaviour change) and settable higher (e.g. 20) on a 2D ground robot. Found on real hardware: an M9N indoors reported hdop ~3.3 (accepted) but vdop over 6 (rejected), with the fix otherwise usable.

---

## [0.3.3]: 2026-07-22

### Added
- **`encoder.topic` and `gnss.fix_topic` parameters.** Every optional and secondary input was already configurable (`imu.topic`, `imu2.topic`, `encoder2.topic`, `gnss.fix2_topic`, `gnss.velocity_topic`, and so on), but the two *primary* inputs were hardcoded: wheel odometry on `/odom/wheels` and GPS on `/gnss/fix`. That meant you could rename the second GPS receiver but not the first, and the only way to match your driver's topic was a launch remap, which is the less discoverable of the two mechanisms. Since almost no driver publishes on `/odom/wheels` (the ROS convention is `/odom` or a controller-namespaced variant) nearly every integration hit this, and pointing at the wrong topic fails silently: the filter runs, publishes, and simply never fuses that sensor. Both are now parameters with their previous values as defaults, so existing configs, launch files, and remaps behave exactly as before. `gnss.fix_topic` covers both message types (NavSatFix, or GPSFix when `gnss.use_gps_fix` is true). The node now also logs the IMU, encoder, and GNSS topics it actually subscribed to at startup, so the wiring is verifiable without guessing. The `/odom/wheels` default is kept deliberately: FusionCore publishes its own fused odometry, and defaulting to `/odom` would invite a feedback loop with its own output.
- **`rowcrop_rtk.yaml` config** for outdoor row-crop rovers running RTK GPS + IMU + wheel odometry (weeders, sprayers, scouts, seeders). Sets the RTK noise floor, the physical-plausibility gate (`gnss.max_speed`), gap-gated coast, and GPS-track heading for slow field speeds, and documents the dual-antenna heading options inline. The only per-robot values are the antenna lever arm and the rover's top speed.

### Fixed
- **IMU orientation was silently discarded at startup when the driver left `orientation_covariance` at zero.** The bias window required a strictly positive covariance to accept an orientation, while the runtime path correctly rejected only a negative one. Per the `sensor_msgs/Imu` spec, `-1` means "no orientation data" and all-zeros means "covariance unknown", and plenty of drivers publish a perfectly good quaternion with an unfilled covariance. Those were treated as having no orientation at all, which skipped accelerometer bias initialisation entirely: the bias stayed at zero, so whatever component of gravity the IMU's mounting tilt produced was left in the acceleration channel. A constant acceleration error double-integrates, so position ran away smoothly, reported from the field as roughly 170 m of drift on a 6 m out-and-back with a BNO085. The startup check now matches the runtime check and additionally rejects an all-zero quaternion, which is not a rotation. When no usable orientation is present the log line is now a warning that explains the consequence rather than a quiet info message. Adds `test_imu_orientation_validity` (6 tests) covering the covariance convention and the resulting bias error.
- **`tools/field_record.launch.py` recorded bags with no filter output.** The field-day recording launch started FusionCore with a plain `Node()` and never triggered the lifecycle CONFIGURE transition, so the node sat in `unconfigured` and published nothing. The bag still captured the raw sensor topics, but `/fusion/odom`, `/fusion/debug/gnss_status`, and `/fusion/debug/filter_health` came back empty, which is only discovered after the field day is over. The launch now configures and activates the node, and waits until it is active before starting the recorder so the first seconds of the bag are not missing the `/fusion` topics.
- **`fusioncore.launch.py` and `fusioncore_duatic.launch.py` now bring the node up automatically.** FusionCore is a lifecycle node, but these two launch files started the process and never triggered the initial CONFIGURE transition, so the node sat in `unconfigured` doing nothing: no error, no data, just silence. A first-time user following the README would reasonably conclude FusionCore was broken. Both launch files now emit CONFIGURE and then ACTIVATE, the same pattern `fusioncore_nav2.launch.py` and the Gazebo demo already used. Adds an `autoconfigure` launch argument (default `true`); set it to `false` when a lifecycle manager such as `nav2_lifecycle_manager` drives the node.

---

## [0.3.2]: 2026-07-06

### Fixed
- **Backward time-jumps no longer crash the filter.** A non-monotonic sensor timestamp (a clock rewind, a replayed bag, or a WSL2 clock glitch) previously produced a negative `dt` that drove the UKF covariance non-positive-definite and aborted the process. `predict_to` now re-syncs the clock on a backward jump instead of integrating a negative step, and the UKF floors covariance eigenvalues rather than throwing. Validated on a real NCLT run that used to SIGABRT within ~2 minutes and now survives end to end.
- **Sustained GPS spikes no longer defeat the outlier gate.** Previously the chi2 gate rejected a spike at first, but after `gnss.coast_n` consecutive rejections coast mode inflated the position process noise until the gate widened enough to admit the spike (on an 8 s, 60 m spike the filter lunged to ~62 m error after ~5 s). Coast mode is meant for re-acquisition after a GPS gap, so firing it for a continuously present, consistently rejected GPS (a persistent multipath spike) was the bug. Rejection-triggered coast (and the recovery P-inflate) now only fire when the rejection streak began after a real GPS gap. Validated on a deterministic repro (sustained-spike peak error 62 m to 1.9 m, post-outage re-acquisition preserved) and in the Gazebo demo (FusionCore RMSE 18.15 m to 2.76 m, now clearly below robot_localization's 18.6 m). Adds `test_gnss_coast` (sustained-spike-stays-rejected, outage-still-recovers).
- **Gazebo outdoor demo now works end to end.** The GPS publisher tracked a static crop row instead of the robot (the ros_gz bridge emits empty frame_ids, so the body finder fell through to a heuristic that locked onto scenery): the robot is now identified by its model height. The demo also mixed wall-clock nodes with sim time, which blew up the velocity estimate under headless: every node now runs on sim time. Added a `base_link -> gnss_link` static TF (removes lever-arm warning spam) and the launch now triggers the initial lifecycle CONFIGURE.

### Added
- **Physical-plausibility GNSS gate (`gnss.max_speed`)**: rejects a fix farther from the filter's predicted position than the robot could have moved or drifted since the last accepted fix (`max_speed * dt + margin`). This catches an outlier cluster arriving at a GPS-blackout boundary that a coast-relaxed chi2 gate would otherwise admit. It is a per-platform kinematic spec (like wheel radius), not per-run tuning. Off by default (0.0). New rejection reason `IMPLAUSIBLE_JUMP`; adds two gate unit tests.
- **Adaptive magnetic-disturbance rejection (`magnetometer.field_strength` / `magnetometer.field_tolerance`)**: a clean magnetometer reading's corrected magnitude equals the local Earth field, so a reading whose magnitude deviates (a nearby motor, steel, or rebar) is rejected even when its direction would pass the heading chi2 gate. This is what makes magnetometer absolute-heading robust enough to bound heading drift through multi-minute GPS blackouts on real outdoor hardware. Off by default (field_strength 0.0). Adds three unit tests, including a blackout scenario where heading runs away to ~113 deg on encoder + gyro alone but the magnetometer pins it to ~0.
- **`gnss.coast_min_gap_s`** parameter (default 1.0 s): minimum preceding GPS gap before rejection-triggered coast may fire. Set to 0 to restore the previous gap-agnostic behavior.
- **`headless` and `start_delay` launch args** for `fusioncore_demo.launch.py`: run Gazebo with no GUI (CI / offscreen), and adjust when the robot starts driving.
- **WSL2 UDP-only Fast-DDS profile** (`fusioncore_gazebo/config/fastdds_udp.xml`): the shared-memory transport fails on WSL2 (`RTPS_TRANSPORT_SHM` errors), dropping `/cmd_vel` and corrupting `/clock`. Point `FASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE` at this profile for reliable comms. See the troubleshooting and simulation docs.
- **Benchmark regression tracking**: `evaluate.py` now emits `metrics.json`, and `tools/check_benchmark_regression.py` compares a run against `tools/benchmark_baseline.json` so a tuning change that silently worsens another sequence is caught instead of shipping unnoticed. Documented in `tools/benchmark_regression.md`.

### Changed
- **Documentation accuracy pass**: the benchmark and comparison pages no longer describe the magnetometer as a roadmap item (it ships) or `gnss.max_speed` as hypothetical (it ships), the long-blackout losses are explained honestly as dead-reckoning drift rather than the visible GPS transients, and the published NCLT numbers now carry a note that they predate a controlled full-suite re-run (the 2013-04-05 figure has regressed 12.1 m to ~19.4 m, still a 93% win).

---

## [0.3.1]: 2026-06-24

### Added
- **Raw magnetometer heading fusion**: FusionCore now subscribes to `sensor_msgs/MagneticField` and fuses the heading as a 1-DOF UKF update. Applies hard/soft iron correction (configurable 3-vector bias + 3x3 scale matrix) and tilt compensation using the current filter roll/pitch before fusing. Chi-squared gate (chi2(1, 0.99) = 9.21 by default) rejects magnetic spikes. Heading source hierarchy: DUAL_ANTENNA overrides MAGNETOMETER overrides GPS_TRACK. Enable with `magnetometer.enabled: true`. Requires calibration: collect data with a full 360-degree rotation and run `imu_calib` or `magneto` to get `hard_iron` and `soft_iron` values.
- **`mag_outlier_count` in FilterHealth**: cumulative magnetometer rejection count now published on `/fusion/debug/filter_health` alongside the existing GNSS, IMU, and encoder outlier counts.
- **Magnetometer diagnostics**: when `magnetometer.enabled: true`, a `fusioncore: Magnetometer` status block appears in `/diagnostics` with health state (OK/STALE/NOT_INIT) and outlier count.
- **`magnetometer.topic` subscriber row in topics reference**: documentation now lists the `/imu/mag` subscriber.
- 12 new unit tests: flat heading (east/north/west), declination offset, hard iron correction, tilt compensation, UKF convergence, chi2 gate rejection, heading source hierarchy, outlier counter.
- **IMU lever arm centripetal compensation**: when an IMU lever arm is configured, the measurement function adds the centripetal term (omega x (omega x r)) to the predicted acceleration so an off-center IMU is modeled correctly. Falls back to the zero-allocation hot path when the lever arm is zero, so platforms without one pay no cost.
- **GPS pre-heading lever arm option**: `gnss.apply_lever_arm_pre_heading` applies the antenna lever arm from the first fix, before heading is validated, for setups where the lever arm is known up front.
- **IMU frame auto-resolve**: `imu.frame_id` override resolves the IMU TF frame when a driver publishes an empty `header.frame_id`. Leave empty to use the message frame as before.
- **Lifecycle `autostart` parameter** (default `true`): the node self-transitions `configure` to `activate` about 200 ms after `on_configure()` returns, so it runs standalone without a lifecycle manager. Set `autostart: false` when `nav2_lifecycle_manager` drives the node, to avoid a double-activate.
- **Certified hardware config registry**: curated, tested YAML configs for known hardware setups.
- **GNSS Doppler bridge package and Gazebo demo infrastructure**: new `fusioncore_ublox` package plus simulation tooling for an end-to-end outdoor scenario.
- **Production-grade Gazebo demo with multi-event GPS scenario**: scripted GPS outlier and dropout events for reproducible demos.
- **Docker support**: published image at `ghcr.io/manankharwar/fusioncore` with CI auto-tagging on release, plus a Docker tutorial in the docs.
- **Field tooling**: bag-recording launch file, a field day checklist, and four troubleshooting guides.

### Changed
- **`fusioncore_ros` migrated to `ament_cmake_auto`** for ROS 2 Lyrical support: Lyrical dropped `ament_target_dependencies`, so build dependencies now come from `package.xml`. Added `std_msgs` as an explicit dependency for the `GnssStatus`/`FilterHealth` messages. Eigen3 and PROJ stay explicit.
- **tf2 headers use `.hpp` uniformly**: Lyrical renamed `tf2/LinearMath/*.h` to `.hpp`. The temporary `__has_include` guard was dropped in favor of `.hpp` everywhere. Still builds on Jazzy.

### Fixed
- **Sensor subscriptions now use `SensorDataQoS` (BEST_EFFORT)**: all sensor subscriptions previously used the default reliable QoS, which silently fails to connect to standard sensor drivers that publish best-effort. Switching to `SensorDataQoS` makes IMU, GPS, and encoder topics connect out of the box.

---

## [0.3.0]: 2026-06-04

### Added
- **GNSS observability topics**: every GPS fix now publishes a structured message on `/fusion/debug/gnss_status` with the exact rejection reason (`ACCEPTED`, `CHI2_FAILED`, `HDOP_HIGH`, `MIN_SATS`, `FIX_TYPE_LOW`, `DELAY_TOO_LARGE`), Mahalanobis distance squared vs the chi2 threshold, fix metadata, and current coast mode state. Replaces the generic warning log line with auditable per-fix data.
- **Filter health topic**: `/fusion/debug/filter_health` publishes at 1 Hz with innovation norms per sensor, position and heading 1-sigma uncertainty (meters and degrees), heading source, GPS coast mode state, and cumulative outlier counts. All fields are plain `float64`, plottable directly in Foxglove, PlotJuggler, or rqt without a custom panel.
- **Two new message types**: `fusioncore_ros/msg/GnssStatus` and `fusioncore_ros/msg/FilterHealth`. No external dependencies added.
- **Lever arm sigma gating**: lever arm correction now requires heading uncertainty below `gnss.lever_arm_max_heading_sigma_deg` (default 20°) in addition to `heading_validated`. During prolonged turns where heading degrades, the lever arm is silently disabled until heading tightens. `lever_arm_used` and `heading_sigma_deg` published on `/fusion/debug/gnss_status` for every fix.
- **Configurable heading motion thresholds**: `gnss.track_heading_min_speed` and `gnss.track_heading_max_yaw_rate` were previously hardcoded at 0.2 m/s and 0.3 rad/s. Now exposed as YAML parameters so platforms with different motion profiles can tune when GPS displacement counts toward heading observability.
- **Complete config YAML**: `fusioncore.yaml` rewritten to document all 87 parameters with inline explanations. Every hardware YAML updated with missing params (`q_encoder_wz_bias`, `outlier_threshold_vslam`, `adaptive.ground_constraint`, correct motion models).

### Fixed
- **Mahalanobis distance computed once per GPS fix**: previously `predict_measurement` ran twice for GNSS updates (once in `is_outlier`, once implicitly). Now computed inline with a single LDLT factorization that is also stored for observability.
- **`configuration.md` had a non-existent param**: `gnss.degraded_noise_multiplier` was documented but never implemented. Removed. Also removed a duplicate coast mode section.
- **Husky config missing motion model**: `clearpath_husky.yaml` had no `motion_model` set. Added `DifferentialDrive`: Husky is a differential drive robot and the config should reflect that.
- **CITATION.cff stale**: was at 0.2.3 while code was at 0.2.4. Synced.

### Changed
- Rejection log messages now include structured fields: `GNSS fix rejected: CHI2_FAILED (hdop=1.20, d2=847.3, threshold=16.27)` instead of the previous generic message.

---

## [0.2.4]: 2026-05-19

### Added
- **`gps_msgs/GPSFix` support**: set `gnss.use_gps_fix: true` to subscribe to `/gnss/fix` as `gps_msgs/GPSFix` instead of `sensor_msgs/NavSatFix`. Unlocks RTK_FLOAT status (status code 20, unreachable via NavSatFix), uses receiver-native `hdop`/`vdop` fields, `satellites_used` for the quality gate, and `err_horz`/`err_vert` (95% CI bounds) as a fallback covariance source. Default is `false`; existing NavSatFix setups are unaffected.

### Changed
- `package.xml` (both packages): maintainer name corrected to Manan Kharwar, maintainer email updated
- `package.xml` (both packages): added `<url>` tags for website, repository, bugtracker, and documentation so index.ros.org renders clickable links

---

## [0.2.3]: 2026-05-10

### Added
- **VSLAM pose fusion**: accepts `nav_msgs/Odometry` from ORB-SLAM3, MOLA, slam_toolbox, or any VIO/LIO source via `vslam.topic`. Enables visual-inertial fusion without GPS.
- **Dual IMU support**: second IMU input via `imu2.topic` with independent noise and outlier parameters.
- **GPS velocity fusion**: fuses Doppler-derived velocity from a GNSS receiver via `gnss.velocity_topic`.
- **Radar Doppler velocity fusion**: fuses radar radial velocity via `radar.velocity_topic`.
- **Pluggable motion models**: select differential drive, Ackermann, or omnidirectional via `motion_model` parameter.
- **Sensor wait**: filter holds initialization until all declared sensors have published at least once.
- **Deterministic replay**: `use_sim_time`-aware replay for reproducible benchmark runs.
- **Docker container and `quick_test.sh`**: one-command environment for testing without a full ROS install.
- **`imu.topic` parameter**: override the IMU subscription topic at runtime without launch file changes.
- **Adaptive R-inflation**: breaks cascading outlier rejection loops when GPS quality degrades gradually.
- **`publish.tf` toggle**: suppress TF broadcast independently of odometry publishing for multi-robot setups.
- Ackermann vehicle configuration and documentation.
- GPS velocity and wheel slip detection documentation.

### Fixed
- VSLAM frame alignment and reinitialization recovery after GPS-denied stretches.
- `encoder2` noise parameters and config accuracy.
- `nav2_params` global_frame corrected from `map` to `odom` for GPS-only navigation.
- Dockerfile apt list errors on fresh builds.
- `quick_test.sh` four-check validation on clean setup.

---

## [0.2.2]: 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **`init.stationary_window` hangs with zero-timestamp IMU drivers**: the bias window used message timestamps to measure elapsed time. IMU drivers that publish `stamp={sec=0, nanosec=0}` caused the window to never complete, silently blocking filter initialization and preventing `/fusion/odom` from publishing. Window timing now uses wall clock (`this->now()`), making it immune to message timestamp values.
- **`publish.force_2d` incomplete**: `force_2d: true` zeroed `position.z` in the published odometry and TF but left `twist.linear.z` (vertical velocity) non-zero. For a ground robot, publishing a non-zero VZ is misleading. Both are now zeroed consistently.

### Added
- **Troubleshooting page**: covers the most common failure modes: lifecycle not activating, Madgwick filter conflict, zero-timestamp IMU drivers, TF conflicts, outlier gate tuning, and more.
- **RTABMAP + Madgwick separation guide** in `icp-indoor.md`: documents the correct IMU topic split when running FusionCore alongside RTABMAP and `icp_odometry`.

---

## [0.2.1]: 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **`duatic_mecanum.yaml`**: `ukf.q_orientation` was `0.01`, causing yaw drift at IMU rates. Corrected to `1.0e-9`.
- **CMakeLists versions**: `fusioncore_ros` and `fusioncore_core` project versions were out of sync with `package.xml`. Both now track `0.2.1`.

### Added
- **`wheels_indoor.yaml`**: new hardware config for any indoor robot with IMU + wheel odometry, no GPS. Covers differential drive, mecanum, Turtlebot3, ROS 2 Control, Nav2 default setups.
- **`icp_indoor.yaml`**: new hardware config for indoor robots using LiDAR ICP odometry (KISS-ICP, rtabmap `icp_odometry`) instead of or alongside wheel encoders.
- **Hardware docs**: new decision table ("Which setup are you?") and per-config setup guides for indoor wheel and ICP setups.

---

## [0.1.1]: 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- **UKF stability**: resolved numerical instability in predict step; covariance matrix
  no longer diverges during long runs without sensor updates.
- **GPS fusion**: corrected position bias introduced by incorrect ECEF→ENU origin
  anchoring; fixes steady-state position offset.
- **Position bias**: removed residual bias accumulation in the motion model that
  appeared after extended straight-line travel.
- **Eigen rosdep key**: added missing `eigen` entry to `rosdep` dependencies so
  the buildfarm can resolve the dependency without manual intervention.
- **Sensor dropout handling**: improved graceful degradation when IMU or GNSS
  messages stop arriving mid-run.

### Added
- **`compass_msgs`**: moved into this repo as a first-party package; provides the
  `compass_msgs/Azimuth` message type for dual-antenna and magnetometer heading.
- **Mahalanobis outlier rejection**: GPS jumps and other sensor spikes are now
  gated before the UKF update step; position remains stable during brief GNSS outages.
- **UKF numerical stability hardening**: symmetric covariance enforcement and
  near-zero variance clamping added throughout the filter.
- **IMU gravity model**: accelerometer measurement function now correctly accounts
  for the gravity vector in the body frame (ENU z-up convention).
- **Full IMU replay retrodiction**: GNSS delay compensation now replays every
  buffered IMU message rather than using a single approximate `predict(dt)` call;
  handles up to 500 ms late measurements.
- **Docs published to docs.ros.org**: all four packages (`fusioncore_core`,
  `fusioncore_ros`, `fusioncore_gazebo`, `compass_msgs`) are now live under the
  Jazzy distribution.

### Changed
- `.vscode/` removed from version control; added to `.gitignore`.
- All package versions bumped to `0.1.1` to align with the rosdistro release.

---
